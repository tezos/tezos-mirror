# Michelson data can be displayed using three different unparsing
# modes: Readable, Optimized, and Optimized_legacy. The storage of
# this contract has a type meant to show the differences between these
# three: It uses the address type because it is displayed differently
# in Readable mode than the two other modes. It uses comb pairs of
# length 4 because they are displayed differently in Optimized and
# Optimized_legacy modes.
