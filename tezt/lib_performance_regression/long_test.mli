(** Long test registration and helpers. *)

(** {2 Registering Tests} *)

(** Timeout specifications.

    Contrary to regular tests, long tests must have a timeout.
    Indeed, as long tests can run for days, there is no global timeout.
    So if a test got stuck and never finished, the whole process would
    get stuck forever.

    For instance, [Hours 10] means that your test should fail
    if it has been running for more than 10 hours.

    Timeouts are only a safety measure to prevent a test from blocking forever.
    They are not meant to be used as a way to check that a test runs in a given
    amount of time. They should thus significantly be over-estimated.
    A good rule of thumb is to:
    - multiply by 10 for tests that take minutes to run;
    - multiply by 5 for tests that take hours to run;
    - multiply by 2 for tests that take days to run.
    For instance, a test that usually takes between 10 to 20 hours to run
    could have a timeout of about 3 days.

    You should still try to avoid waiting for events that may not happen,
    and if you have to, try to also wait for another event that indicates
    that the first event will never happen. In other words, try to
    detect failures early. *)
type timeout = Seconds of int | Minutes of int | Hours of int | Days of int

(** Machines on which to run a given test.

    Tests that are very long (days) should run on their own executor,
    otherwise shorter tests will not be run very often.

    Values of type [executor] are just tags that are added to tests.
    Executors will execute tests which have the tag that correspond to themselves
    (e.g. the x86 executor 1 will execute tests tagged with [x86_executor1]).
    If you specify an empty list of executors, the test will not run on any executor. *)
type executor

(** AMD64 executor number 1. *)
val x86_executor1 : executor

(** AMD64 executor number 2. *)
val x86_executor2 : executor

(** Executor for the block-replay semantic regression tests *)
val block_replay_executor : executor

(** Wrapper over [Test.register] to register a performance regression test.

    Differences with [Test.register] are:
    - the [timeout] parameter;
    - if the test fails, an alert is emitted;
    - tag ["long"] is added;
    - [team] is added to tags and is used to decide where to send alerts;
    - [executors] specifies which machines shall run the test;
    - data points created with [add_data_point] and [measure] are pushed
      at the end of the test (whether it succeeds or not).

    Because an alert is emitted in case of failure, such tests are meant to be run
    not on the CI (which already sends e-mails in case a job fails) but on custom
    architectures. Although it can also make sense to emit alerts from the CI for
    a scheduled pipeline if nobody receives (or read) its alerts.

    Alerts are only sent if the relevant configuration is set (see {!alert}).
    [team] specifies which Slack webhook to use to send alerts.
    If [team] doesn't have a corresponding entry in the configuration file,
    the default Slack webhook is used.

(** {2 Alerts} *)

(** category of an alert message *)
type category = string

(** Emit an alert.

    The alert is sent to a Slack channel.
    It is also written in logs with [Log.error], prefixed with ["Alert: "].

    Be careful with alert fatigue: only send alerts that really need to be acted on.
    Each test can only send a maximum of 2 alerts, and the total number of alerts
    for all tests cannot exceed 100. Alerts can be sent outside of tests, in which
    case only the global limit applies.

    If an alert for the pair [(category, team)]
    (where [team] is the argument given to [register])
    was already sent less than [rate_limit_per_category] seconds ago,
    the alert will not be sent.
    See the Configuration section for documentation about [rate_limit_per_category].

    Default [category] is [""]. *)
val alert : ?category:category -> ('a, unit, string, unit) format4 -> 'a

(** {2 Emitting And Retrieving Data Points} *)

(** Add a data point to be sent at the end of the current test.

    If data points cannot be pushed at the end of the test, an alert is emitted.

    with [Long_test.register] or [Long_test.register_with_protocol]. *)
val add_data_point : InfluxDB.data_point -> unit

(** Wrapper over [InfluxDB.query].

    This wrapper takes care of:
    - providing the configuration;
    - emitting alerts in case something goes wrong;
    - adding a [test = "test title"] clause to the innermost SELECT of the query.

    This wrapper passes the query result to a function.
    The intended behavior of this function is to extract the results,
    e.g. check that they contain the expected number of series
    and the expected columns. If this function raises an exception,
    an alert is emitted and [query] returns [None].
    [query] also returns returns [None] if InfluxDB is not configured or if
    it failed to perform the query.

    If [log] is [true], log the results using [Log.debug]. Default is [false]. *)

(** Retrieve statistics about measurements made in previous test runs.

    Usage: [get_previous_stats measurement field stats]

    Example: [get_previous_stats "rpc" "duration" Stats.(_3 mean median stddev)]

    This retrieves statistics specified by [stats] for the field named [field]
    of measurement named [measurement]. Only the [limit] most recent data points
    are considered in the statistics.

    [tags] is a list of [(tag, value)] pairs.
    If [tags] is specified, only data points that are tagged
    with [tag] equal to [value] for all [tags] are returned.

    This returns [None] if:
    - InfluxDB is not configured;
    - the data points cannot be retrieved (in which case an alert is also emitted);
    - less than [minimum_count] data points exist (default value is [3]).

    Otherwise it returns [Some (count, average)]
    where [count] is the number of data points which were used
    (with [minimum_count <= count <= limit]).

    If [tags] is specified, only data points that are tagged
    with [tag] equal to [value] for all [tags] are returned.

(** {2 Regression Testing} *)

(** Which statistics to compare with previous data points. *)
type check = Mean | Median

(** Compare data points from the current test with previous tests.

    Usage: [check_regression measurement field]

    This compare two sets of data points:
    - the set of current data points;
    - the set of previous data points.

    The set of current data points is [data_points], which defaults to the
    current pending data points. Only data points for [measurement] are used,
    and only if they have a field [field] with a float value.

    [tags] is a list of [(tag, value)] pairs.
    If [tags] is specified, only data points that are tagged
    with [tag] equal to [value] for all [tags] are used.

    If the set of data points to use is empty, the function
    returns immediately without doing anything.

    The set of previous data points is obtained by querying InfluxDB.
    If InfluxDB is not configured, or if less than [minimum_previous_count]
    previous data points exist, the function returns without doing anything else.
    If more than [minimum_previous_count] previous data points are available,
    the last [previous_count] points are used.

    The mean or median (depending on [check]) of those two sets is compared.
    If the value for the current data points is more than the value for
    the previous data points multiplied by [1. +. margin], an alert is emitted.

    If [stddev] is [true], this also logs the standard deviation of the previous
    data points.

    Default values:
    - [previous_count = 10]
    - [minimum_previous_count = 3]
    - [margin = 0.2]
    - [check = Mean]
    - [stddev = false]

    @raise Invalid_arg if no test is currently running, or if it was not registered
    with [Long_test.register] or [Long_test.register_with_protocol]. *)

(** Do something and measure how long it takes.

    Usage: [time measurement f]

    This executes [f], measures the [time] it takes to run, and adds
    a data point for [measurement] with field ["duration"] equal to [time].
    If [f] raises an exception, data points are not pushed and the
    exception is propagated.

    If [repeat] is specified, call [f] [repeat] times to obtain as many
    data points.

    of the function. If you only want to measure parts of the execution,
    or if you want to use something more precise than [Unix.gettimeofday],
    or if you want to measure something which is not time, use [measure] instead.

    Does nothing if Grafana or InfluxDB are not configured.

val update_grafana_dashboard : Grafana.dashboard -> unit

(** {2 Configuration} *)

(** This module should be initialized with [init] to read the configuration file.
    If not, default values are used.

    If you don't need to send alerts, send data points, and retrieve
    data points, you do not need to write a configuration file.
    If you do intend to run the tests yourself, you should store data points
    in your own database though. Indeed, time measurements only make sense
    when they are compared with other measurements that have been run on
    the same hardware.

    This module sends data points to an InfluxDB database, queries data points
    from this database, and sends alerts to a Slack webhook. To configure this
    integration, write a configuration file in one of the following locations:

    - $TEZT_CONFIG
    - ./tezt_config.json
    - $HOME/.tezt_config.json

    More precisely, if environment variable TEZT_CONFIG is set to a non-empty
    value, the location is read from the file located at this value.
    If this variable does not denote a valid configuration file, the program exits.
    If this variable is empty or not set, other configuration files are tried:
    the first one which exists is read. If the first one that exists is not
    a valid configuration file, the program exits. If no configuration file exists,
    default configuration values are used.

    The contents of this file should look like:
