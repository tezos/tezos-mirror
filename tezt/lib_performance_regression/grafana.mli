(** Create Grafana dashboards. *)

(** Grafana configuration.

    [url] is the base URL of the Grafana API.

    [api_token] is the bearer token to use in the Authorization header.
    If not provided, it will try to connect without authenticating (insecure mode).

    [data_source] is the name of the InfluxDB data source configured in Grafana. *)
type config = {
  url : Uri.t;
  api_token : string option;
  data_source : string;
  timeout : float;
}

(** Read a Grafana configuration from a JSON value. *)
val config_of_json : JSON.t -> config

(** Y axes for Grafana panels.

    [format] is the unit of the axis.
    A typical example is ["s"], meaning "seconds".
    See Grafana documentation for other possible values. *)
type yaxis = {format : string; label : string option}

(** Represent a duration, used to express intervals for example. *)
type duration =
  | Seconds of int
  | Minutes of int
  | Hours of int
  | Days of int
  | Weeks of int
  | Month of int
  | Years of int

(** The alias associated to a curve in the graph. *)
type alias = string

(** Grafana graph panels.

    Queries should use [Grafana_time_filter] in their WHERE clause
    and [Grafana_interval] in a GROUP BY time clause to reduce the size of the query.
    If an [interval] is specified, it will represent the minimum accepted by [Grafana_interval]
    to draw the graph.

    The GROUP BY time clause should usually also contain a FILL clause to make
    continuous graphs instead of bunches of dots.

    Each query is optionally associated to an alias. This alias will be used to name the resulting
    curve in the graph key. If this alias is not given, Grafana will deduce it automatically from
    the query.

    Example query:
    [
      InfluxDB.select
        [Function (MEAN, Field "duration")]
        ~from:(Measurement "rpc")
        ~where:Grafana_time_filter
        ~group_by:(Time {interval = Grafana_interval; tag = None; fill = None})
    ] *)
type graph = {
  title : string;
  description : string;
  queries : (InfluxDB.select * alias option) list;
  interval : duration option;
  yaxis_1 : yaxis option;
  yaxis_2 : yaxis option;
}

(** Grafana panels.

    Rows are horizontal separators between graphs, with a title. *)
type panel = Row of string | Graph of graph

(** Grafana dashboards.

    [uid] is a unique identifier of your choosing.
    It will be used in the URL of the dashboard.
    It must be composed of between 1 and 128 alphanumeric characters, dashes, periods
    or underscores. *)
type dashboard = {
  uid : string;
  title : string;
  description : string;
  panels : panel list;
}

(** Create or update a dashboard.

    If the dashboard already exists, it is deleted first.
    All version history is lost.

    @raise Invalid_arg if the dashboard UID is invalid. *)
val update_dashboard : config -> dashboard -> unit Lwt.t

(** Similar to update_dashboard, except it is provided as a raw JSON
    represented as a string. *)
val update_dashboard_from_json :
  config -> json:string -> uid:string -> unit Lwt.t

(** Make a simple SELECT query for a graph panel.

    Usage: [simple_query
             ~tags:[("tag1", "value1"), ("tag2", "value2")]
             ~measurement
             ~field
             ~test:test_title
             ()]

    Default [tags] is an empty list.

    This returns the following query:
    [
      SELECT MEAN(field)
      FROM measurement
      WHERE $timeFilter AND test = test_title AND tag1 = value1 AND tag2 = value2
      GROUP BY time($__interval) fill(previous)
    ] *)
val simple_query :
  ?tags:(InfluxDB.tag * string) list ->
  measurement:InfluxDB.measurement ->
  field:InfluxDB.field ->
  test:string ->
  unit ->
  InfluxDB.select

(** Make a graph panel from a simple query.

    Usage: [simple_graph ~measurement ~field ~test ()]

    The query is built using {!simple_query}.

    Default [title] is the measurement name.
    Default [description] is [""].
    Default [yaxis_format] is [s] (seconds).
    Default [tags] is an empty list. *)
val simple_graph :
  ?title:string ->
  ?description:string ->
  ?yaxis_format:string ->
  ?tags:(InfluxDB.tag * string) list ->
  ?interval:duration ->
  measurement:InfluxDB.measurement ->
  field:InfluxDB.field ->
  test:string ->
  unit ->
  panel

(** Make a graph panel that draws a curve per given tag.

    Usage: [graphs_per_tags
             ~measurement
             ~field
             ~test:test_title
             ~tags:[(tag1, value1); (tag2, value2)]
             ()]

    This will draw a curve in the resulting graph for each one of the following request:

    [
      SELECT MEAN(field)
      FROM measurement
      WHERE $timeFilter AND test = test_title AND tag1 = value1
      GROUP BY time($__interval) fill(previous)
    ]

    [
      SELECT MEAN(field)
      FROM measurement
      WHERE $timeFilter AND test = test_name AND tag2 = value2
      GROUP BY time($__interval) fill(previous)
    ]

    Default [title] is the measurement name.
    Default [description] is [""].
    Default [yaxis_format] is [s] (seconds).
    Default [tags] is an empty list. *)
val graphs_per_tags :
  ?title:string ->
  ?description:string ->
  ?yaxis_format:string ->
  ?interval:duration ->
  measurement:InfluxDB.measurement ->
  field:InfluxDB.field ->
  test:string ->
  tags:(InfluxDB.tag * string) list ->
  unit ->
  panel
