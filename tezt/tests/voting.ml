(* Testing
   -------
   Component:    Amendment process
   Invocation:   dune exec tezt/tests/main.exe -- --file voting.ml
   Subject:      Test the voting process from proposal to adoption.

   This test activates a protocol [from_protocol]. Then it uses the
   client's [submit ballot] command on a protocol [to_protocol] that will
   win the election, and on other protocols [loser_protocols].
   Then the [bake for] command is used to move to the exploration period.
   Another vote using [submit ballot] is made and the [bake for] command
   is used to move to the cooldown period, then to the promotion period.
   Another vote using [submit ballot] is made and the [bake for] command
   is used to move to the adoption period.

   RPCs are used regularly to check the current level and the current period
   information match what we expect.

   Optionally, [from_protocol] can be an injected test protocol.
   In this scenario, another node is started at the end of the adoption period.
   This is to check that injected protocols are propagated to other nodes
   after the migration. *)

       In addition, should this test turn out to be flaky, some pointers to make

       - at more blocks to each voting period by increasing
         [blocks_per_voting_period].
       - (in tenderbake) increasing the delay between blocks, by increasing
         the constants [minimal_block_delay] and [delay_increment_per_round]

       In conjunction, they will give the test more time to perform actions and
       assertions in between blocks.

       The parts of the test that are inherently flaky are wrapped in calls to
       [do_before_level] and [do_in_period]. These are:

         - Submitting the protocol proposal before the end of the second
           proposal period (we ignore the first proposal period).
         - Casting votes before the end of the Exploration period
         - Recasting votes before the end of the Promotion period

       If the test turns out flaky, I suggest investigating there.
