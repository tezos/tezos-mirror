  (** This test checks that the light client never does a useless RPC.

    I.e. it checks that if the light client requested

    it doesn't later request
    [/chains/<main>/blocks/<head>/context/merkle_tree/some_path/some_other_path]

    In this scenario, the light client should look directly in the data within the tree received by the first request.

    For this, this test inspects the debug output produced by
    setting TEZOS_LOG to light_mode->debug. This causes the client
    to print the RPCs done to retrieve pieces of the context (do_rpc lines):

    light_mode: API call: do_rpc v1
    light_mode: API call: get v1;constants
    light_mode: API call: get v1;first_level
    light_mode: API call: do_rpc pending_migration_balance_updates
