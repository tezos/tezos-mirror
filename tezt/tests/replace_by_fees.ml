(* This is a generic function used to write most of the tests below. In
   addition to the test's title the function takes:
   - a first operation to inject [op1], and the checks to perform [incheck1]
   while injecting,
   - a second operation to inject [op2], the checks to perform [incheck2]
   while injecting, and the checks [postcheck2] to perform on op1 and op2's
   hashes after their injections,
   - if provided, a third operation to inject [op3], the checks to perform
   [incheck3] while injecting, and the checks [postcheck3] to perform on op1,
   op2 and op3's hashes after their injections.

   The function does the following:
   - construct a first (eventually batched) operation, forge and inject it, and
     monitor its propagation through a main and an observer nodes using
     function [incheck1],
   - construct a second (eventually batched) operation with the same manager,
     forge and inject it, and monitor its propagation through a main and an
     observer nodes using function [incheck2],
   - use function [postcheck2] to make some checks about the operations
     once the second one is injected (eg. is the first operation validated or
     removed ? ...)
   - if a third operation and its checkers are provided:
   + construct a third (eventually batched) operation with the same manager,
     forge and inject it, and monitor its propagation through a main and an
     observer nodes using function [incheck3],
   + use function [postcheck3] to make some checks about the operations (eg.
   to check which one is validated, which one is removed, ...)
