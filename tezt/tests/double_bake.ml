(* This tests aims to detect a double baking evidence with an
   accuser. The scenario is the following:

   1. Run Node 1 and Node 2, connect Node 1 to Node 2 and bake the
   activation block. Terminate Node 2.

   2. Bake 3 blocks with bootstrap1 key on Node 1. Terminate Node 1.

   3. Then, restart Node 2 and bake 2 blocks from level 1, the
   first one with bootstrap2 key and the second one with
   bootstrap1 key.
   Thus, the block at level 3 is double baked (and we
   ensure that the double baked blocks are different as they emanate
   from 2 distinct branches),

   4. Run Node 3 with its accuser and wait for
   the accuser to be ready.

   5. Connect Node 3 with Node 2. Wait for Node 3 to catch up. The
   accuser has seen 1 block at level 3 baked by bootstrap1.

   6. Run Node 1 and connect to Node 3. Wait for Node 3 to
   catch up.
   Because the branch on Node 1 is longer, Node 3 needs to switch
   from its current branch to Node 1's branch. This way, we ensure
   that Node 3 will revalidate a block at level 3 from Node 1's
   branch. Consequently, the accuser will see a second block at level
   3 baked by bootstrap1.

   7. Bake a block with the denunciation operation.

   8. Check the denunciation is in the last block. *)
