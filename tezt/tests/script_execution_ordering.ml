type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a tree list

(* This test to verifies contract execution order.
   There are 3 contracts:
   - Storer: Appends its argument to storage.
   - Caller: Calls the list of unit contracts in its storage.
   - Appender: Calls the string contract in its storage with a stored argument.

   For each test, there is one unique Storer. Each test is
   parameterized by a tree and the expected final storage of the
   Storer. A leaf in the tree is a string. Inner nodes are lists of
   leafs/inner nodes. The test maps maps over this tree to build a
   tree of contracts. Leaf nodes map to Appender contracts calling
   the Storer. Inner nodes map to Caller contract that calling
   children.

   Example. Given the tree: ["A", ["B"], "C"], we obtain
   Caller([Appender("A"), Caller([Appender("B")]), Appender("C")])
   Before the protocol 009, contract execution order was in BFS
   In BFS, Storer would've ended up with storage ACB.
   In DFS, Storer will end up with storage ABC. *)
