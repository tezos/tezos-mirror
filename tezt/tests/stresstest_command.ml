(** Run the [stresstest] command in an isolated node with sources
    provided in various formats; then check the number and the sources
    of the operations in the mempool and in subsequently baked blocks.

    More precisely, this test checks that:

    - After letting the [stresstest] command run for a while on a
      given head, the mempool contains exactly one validated operation by
      each source account provided to the command. The same goes for
      manager operations included in the next baked block. (Note that
      this is true in a minimalist context where no operation injection
      happens aside from [stresstest], and there are few enough source
      accounts that all the new operations can fit in a block.)

    - This holds regardless of whether a source account has been
      provided in the form of an alias, a public key hash, or an explicit
      key - or even provided redundantly in several of these
      categories. *)

     protocol with twice as many bootstraps ([n_bootstraps_total]),
     then select every other one of those to obtain the list of
     [bootstraps_to_use].

     Among the list of [bootstraps_to_use], elements of index 0 to
     [source_aliases_cutoff] (both included) will be given to the

     test that the command tolerates them. The various bounds should
     be at least two units apart such that each category has at least
