Available services:
  
  + levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/commitment
        Return the accepted commitment associated to the given slot index and
        published at the given level. 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/content
        Retrieve the content of the slot associated with the given
        commitment. 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/pages
        Fetch slot as list of pages 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/pages/<int>/proof
        Compute the proof associated with a page of a given slot. 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/shards/<int>/content
        Fetch shard as bytes 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/status
        Return the status for the given slot. 
  + p2p/
    - POST /p2p/connect
        Connect to a new peer. 
    + gossipsub/
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/backoffs
          Get the backoffs of the peers with a backoff, per topic. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/connections
          Get this node's currently active connections. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/message_cache
          Get the number of message ids in the message cache, grouped by
          heartbeat tick and topic. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/scores
          Get the scores of the peers with a known score. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/topics
          Get the topics this node is currently subscribed to. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/topics/peers
          Get an association list between each topic subscribed to by the
          connected peers and the remote peers subscribed to that topic. If
          the 'subscribed' flag is given, then restrict the output to the
          topics this node is subscribed to. 
    + peers/
      - GET /p2p/peers/by-id/<peer_id>
          Get info of the requested peer 
      - PATCH /p2p/peers/by-id/<peer_id>
          Change the permissions of a given peer. With `{acl: ban}`:
          blacklist the given peer and remove it from the whitelist if
          present. With `{acl: open}`: removes the peer from the blacklist
          and whitelist. With `{acl: trust}`: trust the given peer
          permanently and remove it from the blacklist if present. The peer
          cannot be blocked (but its host IP still can). In all cases, the
          updated information for the peer is returned. If input is omitted,
          this is equivalent to using the `GET` version of this RPC. 
      - DELETE /p2p/peers/disconnect/<peer_id>
          Disconnect from a peer. 
      - GET /p2p/peers/info
          Get list of known peers and their corresponding info. 
      - GET /p2p/peers/list
          By default, get the list of known peers. When the 'connected' flag
          is given, then only get the connected peers. 
    + points/
      - GET /p2p/points/by-id/<point>
          Get info of the requested point 
      - DELETE /p2p/points/disconnect/<point>
          Disconnect from a point. 
      - GET /p2p/points/info
          By default, get the list of known points and their corresponding
          info. When the 'connected' flag is given, then only get the
          connected points. 
  - /plugin <dynamic>
  - GET /profiles
      Return the list of current profiles tracked by the DAL node. 
  - PATCH /profiles
      Update the list of profiles tracked by the DAL node. Note that it does
      not take the bootstrap profile as it is incompatible with other
      profiles. 
  - GET /profiles/<pkh>/attested_levels/<int32>/assigned_shard_indices
      Return the shard indexes assigned to the given public key hash at the
      given level. 
  - GET /profiles/<pkh>/attested_levels/<int32>/attestable_slots
      Return the currently attestable slots at the given attested level by
      the given public key hash. A slot is attestable at level [l] if it is
      published at level [l - attestation_lag] and *all* the shards assigned
      at level [l] to the given public key hash are available in the DAL
      node's store. 
  - POST /slots
      Post a slot to the DAL node, computes its commitment and commitment
      proof, then computes the correspoding shards with their proof. The
      result of this RPC can be directly used to publish a slot header. 
  - GET /version
      version
