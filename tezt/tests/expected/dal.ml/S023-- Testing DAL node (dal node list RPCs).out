Available services:
  
  - GET /health
      Performs health checks on the DAL node, evaluating key components of
      the DAL node. Returns a health status indicating whether the DAL node
      is 'Up', 'Down', or 'Degraded' based on the results of these checks. 
  - GET /last_processed_level
      Returns the last (finalized) L1 level which was processed by the DAL
      node. 
  + levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/commitment
        Return the commitment associated to the given slot index and
        published at the given level, if any. The commitment is fetched from
        the skip-list storage. Note that the commitment is not present in the
        storage immediately after publication, but only when its attestation
        status is known and final. 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/content
        Retrieve the content of the slot whose id is given. 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/pages
        Fetch slot as list of pages 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/pages/<int>/proof
        Compute the proof associated with a page of a given slot. 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/shards/<int>/content
        Fetch shard as bytes 
    - GET /levels/<int32>/slots/<int>/status
        Return the status for the given slot. For operator nodes only. 
  - GET /monitor/synchronized
      Returns the stream of synchronization statuses of the DAL node with the
      L1 node. 
  + p2p/
    - POST /p2p/connect
        Connect to a new peer. 
    + gossipsub/
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/backoffs
          Get the backoffs of the peers with a backoff, per topic. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/connections
          Get this node's currently active connections. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/fanout
          Returns the fanout peers per topic alongside the last publication
          time on the topic. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/mesh
          Get the mesh of the peer. Concretely, the RPC returns a list of
          topics, where each topic is associated to the remote peers with
          which the current node shares a full connection (on that topic).
          Optional arguments allow to restrict the output to a given delegate
          or slot index. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/message_cache
          Get the number of message ids in the message cache, grouped by
          heartbeat tick and topic. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/pkhs/peers
          When the 'all' flag is given, get an association list between each
          topic subscribed to by the connected peers and the remote peers
          subscribed to that topic. If the 'all' flag is not given, then
          restrict the output to the topics this peer is subscribed to. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/reconnection_delays
          For each unreachable point, retrieve the time remaining until the
          next reconnection attempt. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/scores
          Get the scores of the peers with a known score. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/slot_indexes/peers
          When the 'all' flag is given, get an association list between each
          public key hash part of a topic subscribed to by the connected
          peers and the remote peers subscribed to such topics. If the 'all'
          flag is not given, then restrict the output to the topics this peer
          is subscribed to. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/topics
          Get the topics this node is currently subscribed to. 
      - GET /p2p/gossipsub/topics/peers
          When the 'all' flag is given, get an association list between each
          topic subscribed to by the connected peers and the remote peers
          subscribed to that topic. If the 'all' flag is not given, then
          restrict the output to the topics this peer is subscribed to. 
    + peers/
      - GET /p2p/peers/by-id/<peer_id>
          Get info of the requested peer 
      - PATCH /p2p/peers/by-id/<peer_id>
          Change the permissions of a given peer. With `{acl: ban}`:
          blacklist the given peer and remove it from the whitelist if
          present. With `{acl: open}`: removes the peer from the blacklist
          and whitelist. With `{acl: trust}`: trust the given peer
          permanently and remove it from the blacklist if present. The peer
          cannot be blocked (but its host IP still can). In all cases, the
          updated information for the peer is returned. If input is omitted,
          this is equivalent to using the `GET` version of this RPC. 
      - DELETE /p2p/peers/disconnect/<peer_id>
          Disconnect from a peer. 
      - GET /p2p/peers/info
          Get list of known peers and their corresponding info. 
    + points/
      - GET /p2p/points/by-id/<point>
          Get info of the requested point 
      - DELETE /p2p/points/disconnect/<point>
          Disconnect from a point. 
      - GET /p2p/points/info
          By default, get the list of known points and their corresponding
          info. When the 'connected' flag is given, then only get the
          connected points. 
  - /plugin <dynamic>
  - GET /profiles
      Return the list of current profiles tracked by the DAL node. 
  - PATCH /profiles
      Update the list of profiles tracked by the DAL node. Note that it does
      not take the bootstrap profile as it is incompatible with other
      profiles. 
  + profiles/<pkh>/
    - GET /profiles/<pkh>/attested_levels/<int32>/assigned_shard_indices
        Return the shard indexes assigned to the given public key hash at the
        given level. 
    - GET /profiles/<pkh>/attested_levels/<int32>/attestable_slots
        Return the currently attestable slots at the given attested level by
        the given public key hash. A slot is attestable at level [l] if it is
        published at level [l - attestation_lag] and *all* the shards
        assigned at level [l] to the given public key hash are available in
        the DAL node's store. 
    - GET /profiles/<pkh>/monitor/attestable_slots
        Stream attestable slot ids for a given public key hash [pkh]. A slot
        is attestable for attested level L if it was published at (L -
        attestation_lag) and *all* shards assigned at level L to [pkh] are
        available in the DAL node's store. If some shards of the slot are
        detected as traps for the baker, the slot should not be attested, so
        the id is not sent via the stream. 
  - GET /protocol_parameters
      Returns the protocol parameters as known by the DAL node. An optional
      'level' argument can specify for which level to retrieve them. 
  - GET /published_levels/<int32>/known_traps
      For a given published level, return all the traps known by the node.
      Optional arguments allow to restrict the output to a given delegate or
      slot index. 
  - POST /slots
      Post a slot to the DAL node, computes its commitment and commitment
      proof, then computes the corresponding shards with their proof. The
      result of this RPC can be directly used to publish a slot header. If
      the sent data is smaller than the size of a DAL slot, it is padded with
      the character provided as padding query parameter (defaults to \000).
      If the slot_index query parameter is provided, the DAL node checks that
      its profile allows to publish data on the given slot index. However,
      slot_index is optional and has NO SEMANTIC EFFECT on the produced
      commitment. It exists solely to help reverse proxies route POST /slots
      requests to a DAL node subscribed to the corresponding topics. 
  - GET /synchronized
      Returns the current synchronization status of the DAL node with the L1
      node. 
  - GET /version
      version
