(* This test replicates part of the flextesa test "command_node_synchronization".
   It checks the synchronization of two nodes depending on their history mode.
   The beginning of the scenario is the following:

   1. Node 1 bakes some blocks and Node 2 catches up with Node 1;

   2. Node 2 is killed;

   3. Node 1 bakes many blocks (longer than a cycle).

   What follows depends on the history mode of Node 1.

   a) In rolling mode, synchronization should fail because Node 1 and Node 2 have
   no common ancestor. We check that the caboose for Node 1 is indeed higher than
   when Node 2 was killed.

   b) Otherwise, we check that both nodes synchronize. In full mode, we also check
   that the savepoint is higher than when Node 2 was killed. *)

  (* Number of calls to [octez-client bake for] once the protocol is activated,
     before we kill [node_2]. *)
  let bakes_before_kill = 9 in

  let max_operations_ttl = 1 in

  (* TODO-TB: update the doc strings below, written for
     max_operations_ttl = 0. *)

  (* Number of calls to [octez-client bake for] while [node_2] is not
     running. This number is high enough so that it is bigger than the
     Last-Allowed-Fork-Level or the caboose.

     Since the caboose depends on [max_op_ttl] which is set to [0]
     with the consensus algorithm Emmy* we bake [1 + bakes_before_kill
     + bakes_during_kill = 49] blocks.

     The rationale behind this number is the following:

     The test depends on two special blocks called [checkpoint] (which
     in this case is the same as the [last allowed fork level] since
     no target is not set on the command-line) and [caboose]. The
     [checkpoint] is the block level (often we refer it as the level
     directly) for which there is not reorganisation below this point.
     The [caboose] is the lowest level for which the store knows the
     [block_header] associated. These values are updated by the shell
     using information from the economic protocol when a new cycle
     starts.

     - When the checkpoint is set, its level is [preserved_blocks =
     blocks_preservation_cycles * blocks_per_cycle] behind the current level of
     the head

     - When the [caboose] is set, its level is [max(0, (checkpoint -
     max(preserved_blocks,max_op_ttl)))]. In [Full] and [Archive]
     mode, the [caboose] value is always [0]. For this test, we ensure
     that [preserved_blocks] and [max_op_ttl] are also [0] to save
     some computational time.

     These values are set when the head changes with level [level = 1
     mod blocks_per_cycle] (the modulo 1 comes from the activation
     block).

     In sandbox mode, we have [blocks_preservation_cycles = 2] and
     [blocks_per_cycle = 8].

     Hence, when [node_1] has baked [49] blocks, the checkpoint should
     be at level [49 - 16 = 33] and the [caboose] in rolling history
     mode should be at level [33 - 0 = 33] (and [0] for the other
     history modes). The [0] comes from as explained above that
     [max_op_ttl] and [preserved_blocks] are both set to [0].

     When the [node_1] is in rolling mode, we want to ensure that it
     can't synchronise with [node_2]. Consequently, we want to ensure
     that the [caboose] of [node_1] is above the level of [node_2]
     which is [1+bakes_before_kill = 10].

     Since, the [caboose] is updated at every cycle, the values it
     takes in sandbox mode are [1;9;17; ...]. [17] is the first value
     for which it prevents the synchronisation with [node_2].

     Consequently, to have a [caboose] at level [17] we need a
     checkpoint at level [17] and so the head should be, at least, at
     level [33].

     However, the [caboose] is set asynchronously and checking the
     level of the node is not enough. We have to ensure that the
     [caboose] was set too. This should be done when the [store]
     finishes its merge. This is why we bake [2] more cycles and that
     finally the number of baked blocks is [49].

     To ensure that, we need first to catch an event which says which
     cycle (up to which block) is being merged and then wait for the
     event which indicates the merge is over.

     This may be flaky if merging a store is way slower than baking
     blocks since the store does not trigger a merge when there is
     already one merge in progress. However, we do not observe such
     behavior for this test and we do not handle that currently. *)
