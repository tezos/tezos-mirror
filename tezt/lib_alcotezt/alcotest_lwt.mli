(** Wrapper to run Alcotest tests with Tezt as a backend. *)

(** This module provides a subset of the interface of the [Alcotest] module
    of the real Alcotest library. But instead of using Alcotest to run the tests,
    it uses Tezt. This allows to transition from Alcotest to Tezt without
    having to actually change the code. In turn, this allows to benefit from
    Tezt features such as auto-balancing in the CI. One can then use Tezt's
    modules in the test, to gradually migrate the test to Tezt and stop using
    this wrapper. *)

(** Return type for tests. *)
type return = unit Lwt.t

(** Speed levels. Same as {!Alcotest.speed_level}. *)
type speed_level = [`Quick | `Slow]

(** Test cases.

    The name of the Alcotest test case appears in Tezt's logs,
    but it is not used in the Tezt test title, nor as a tag. *)
type 'a test_case = string * speed_level * ('a -> return)

(** Make a test case. *)
val test_case :
  string -> speed_level -> (Lwt_switch.t -> 'a -> return) -> 'a test_case

(** Make a test case (out of Lwt). *)
val test_case_sync : string -> speed_level -> ('a -> unit) -> 'a test_case

(** Tests.

    In Tezt, the name of the test is used as the title of the test. *)
type 'a test = string * 'a test_case list

(** Run a test suite.

    In Tezt, this calls [Test.register] but does not actually run the test suite.
    The name of the test suite is used as the filename for the Tezt test. *)

  __FILE__:string -> ?tags:string list -> string -> unit test list -> return
