type event = {name : string; value : JSON.t; timestamp : float}

(** Create an accuser.

    This function just creates the [t] value, it does not call [run].

    [path] provides the path to the accuser binary, the default being the one
    derived from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the accuser will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that accuser
    events can be received.

    [base_dir] corresponds to the (useless) "--base-dir" argument of
    the octez-accuser command.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the accuser's node target. The accuser
    will be configured to be synchronised with the given node, and
    will communicate with it.

    If [runner] is specified, the accuser will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.

(** Initialize an accuser.

    This {!create}s an accuser and {!run}, then waits for the accuser
    to be ready, and finally returns the accuser.

    As the accuser usually needs to be connected to a node, we first
    wait for the node to be ready and then, run the accuser. If one
    does not want to wait for the node to be ready, it is necessary to
    use [create] and then [run].

    [path] is the path to accuser binary. By default, it is chosen
    from the [protocol] and is assumed to be at the root.

    The standard output and standard error output of the accuser will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that accuser
    events can be received.

    [event_level] specifies the verbosity of the file descriptor sink.
    The default value is [`Info].

    [base_dir] corresponds to the (useless) "--base-dir" argument of
    the octez-accuser command.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the accuser's node target. The accuser
    will be configured to be synchronised with the given node, and
    will communicate with it.

    If [runner] is specified, the accuser will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.
