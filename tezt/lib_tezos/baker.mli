val liquidity_baking_votefile : ?path:string -> liquidity_baking_vote -> string

(** Create a baker.

    This function just creates a value of type [t], it does not call {!val:run}.

    [path] provides the path to the baker binary, the default being the one
    derived from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the baker will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that baker
    events can be received.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the node used by the baker. The baker
    is configured to use the node's data dir.

    The [Client.t] parameter is the client used by the baker. The baker
    is configured to use the client's base directory.

    If [runner] is specified, the baker will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.

    [delegates] is a list of account aliases (see {!val:Account.key.alias}), e.g.,
    bootstrap accounts (see {!val:Constant.bootstrap_keys}), delegated to this
    baker. This defaults to the empty list, which is a shortcut for "every known
    account".

    [votefile] and [liquidity_baking_toggle_vote] are passed to the baker daemon
    through the flags [--votefile] and [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]. If
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote] is [None], then
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]
    is not passed. If it is [Some x] then [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote x] is
    passed. The default value is [Some Pass].

    [operations_pool], [force_apply_from_round], [state_recorder],
    [node_version_check_bypass] and [node_version_allowed] are passed to the
    baker daemon through the flag [--operations-pool],
    [--force_apply_from_round],
    [--record-state], [--node-version-check-bypass] and
    [--node-version-allowed].

    If [remote_mode] is specified, the baker will run in RPC-only mode.

    If [dal_node] is specified, then it is the DAL node that the baker queries
    in order to determine the attestations it sends to the L1 node. A
    [--dal_node] argument is passed to specify the DAL node's endpoint.

    [minimal_nanotez_per_gas_unit] is an integer passed to the baker daemon
    through the flag [--minimal-nanotez-per-gas-unit].

(** Similar to {!create}, but nodes RPCs addresses, wallet base directory and L1
    data directory are directly provided instead of a {!Client.t}, a {!Node.t}
    and optionally a {!Dal_node.t}.

    The [node_data_dir] parameter provides the (local) node's data directory
    used for baking.

    The [node_rpc_endpoint] parameter provides the (local) node's RPC server
    endpoint to which the baker will connect to.

    The [base_dir] parameter contains needed information about the wallets used
    by the baker.

    If [dal_node_rpc_endpoint] is specified, then it provides the DAL node RPC
    server's endpoint that the baker queries in order to determine the
    attestations it sends to the L1 node. A [--dal_node] argument is passed
    to specify the DAL node's endpoint.

(** Initialize a baker.

    This creates a baker, waits for it to be ready, and then returns it.

    As the baker usually relies on a node, we first
    wait for the node to be ready and then, run the baker.

    The path to the baker binary is chosen from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the baker will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Show the baker daemon name, level and round of the block, and
