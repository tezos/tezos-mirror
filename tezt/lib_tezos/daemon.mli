  (** Wait for a custom event to occur.

      Usage: [wait_for_full daemon name filter]

      If an event named [name] occurs, apply [filter] to its
      whole json, which is of the form:
      {[{
        "fd-sink-item.v0": {
          "hostname": "...",
                      "time_stamp": ...,

                      "event": { <name>: ... }
                               }
        }]}
      If [filter] returns [None], continue waiting.
      If [filter] returns [Some x], return [x].

      [where] is used as the [where] field of the [Terminated_before_event] exception
      if the daemon terminates. It should describe the constraint that [filter] applies,
      such as ["field level exists"].

      It is advised to register such event handlers before starting the daemon,
      as if they occur before being registered, they will not trigger your handler.
      For instance, you can define a promise with
      [let x_event = wait_for daemon "x" (fun x -> Some x)]
      and bind it later with [let* x = x_event]. *)
  val wait_for_full :
    ?where:string -> t -> string -> (JSON.t -> 'a option) -> 'a Lwt.t

  (** Same as [wait_for_full] but ignore metadata from the file descriptor sink.

      More precisely, [filter] is applied to the value of field
      ["fd-sink-item.v0"."event".<name>].

      If the daemon receives a JSON value that does not match the right
      JSON structure, it is not given to [filter] and the event is
      ignored. See [wait_for_full] to know what the JSON value must
      look like. *)
  val wait_for :
    ?where:string -> t -> string -> (JSON.t -> 'a option) -> 'a Lwt.t

  (** Add a callback to be called whenever the daemon emits an event.

      Contrary to [wait_for] functions, this callback is never removed.

      Listening to events with [on_event] will not prevent [wait_for] promises
      to be fulfilled. You can also have multiple [on_event] handlers, although
      the order in which they trigger is unspecified. *)
  val on_event : t -> (event -> unit) -> unit

  (** Add a callback to be called whenever the daemon prints to its stdout.

      Contrary to [wait_for] functions, this callback is never removed.

      Listening to events with [on_stdout] will not prevent [wait_for] promises
      to be fulfilled. You can also have multiple [on_stdout] handlers,
      although the order in which they trigger is unspecified. *)
  val on_stdout : t -> (string -> unit) -> unit

  (** Add a callback to be called whenever the daemon prints to its stderr.
      {!run} must have been called with [capture_stderr] flag set to true,
      to call callbacks registered this way.

      Contrary to [wait_for] functions, this callback is never removed.

      Listening to events with [on_stderr] will not prevent [wait_for] promises
      to be fulfilled. You can also have multiple [on_stderr] handlers,
      although the order in which they trigger is unspecified. *)
  val on_stderr : t -> (string -> unit) -> unit

  (** Register an event handler that logs all events.

      Use this when you need to debug or reverse engineer incoming events.
      Usually you do not want to keep that in the final versions of your tests.

      The [max_length] optional parameter can be used to limit the
      length of the output of each event; outputs longer than the
      limit are truncated at the limit and "[...]" is appended to
      them to mark the truncation. *)
  val log_events : ?max_length:int -> t -> unit

  (** Values returned by {!memory_consumption}. *)

  (** Observe memory consumption of the daemon.

      This function requires [perf] and [heaptrack] in the PATH
      and [kernel.perf_event_paranoid] to be permissive enough.
      Otherwise, the observation will always return [None].

      The returned function gives the peak of memory consumption
      observed since the observation has started.

      [memory_consumption daemon] starts the observation and returns
      [Some (Observe get)]. [get ()] stops the observation and
      returns the observation memory consumption.
  *)
  val memory_consumption : t -> observe_memory_consumption Lwt.t
end

(** {2 Filter combinators } *)

(** Transform an event filter into one that waits for several events.

    Usage: [n_events n filter]

    [n] represents the number of events that the resulting filter must
    wait for.

    [filter] is the initial filter that must be transformed. It is
    expressed as a function that takes a serialized input (for example
    a [JSON.t]) and returns some deserialized output (an event) if no
    error occured during the decoding and input matched some acceptance
    criteria.

    The function evaluates into a new filter, i.e. a new function that
    takes a serialized input and returns [None] until [n] calls where
    the given input passes the initial [filter] are performed.

    On the [nth] successful call, the resulting filter will return some
    list of the [n] successuful outputs of [filter]. The order of the
    given inputs is preserved in the list of outputs.

    The behavior of the resulting filter is unspecified after the list
    has been returned. *)
val n_events : int -> ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a -> 'b list option

(** Tranform an event filter into one that waits for several events to
    return the last one.

   Similar to [n_events] but only returns the last successful event
   instead of the whole list. *)
