(** Spawn Tezos nodes and control them. *)

(** Convention: in this module, some functions implement node commands;
    those functions are named after those commands.
    For instance, [Node.config_init] corresponds to [octez-node config init],
    and [Node.run] corresponds to [octez-node run].

    The arguments of those functions are also named after the actual arguments.
    For instance, [?network] is named after [--network], to make
    [Node.config_init ~network:"carthagenet"] look as close as possible
    to [octez-node config init --network carthagenet].

    Most options have default values which are not necessarily the default values
    of [octez-node]. Indeed, the latter are tailored for Mainnet, but here we
    use defaults which are tailored for the sandbox. In particular, the default
    value for [?network] is ["sandbox"].
    However, if you specify an option such as [~network] or [~history_mode],
    they are passed to the node unchanged, to reduce surprises.

    These conventions are also followed in the [Client] module. *)

(** History modes for the node. *)

(** The parameter for [Full] And [Rolling] mode is called [additional_cycles].

    For the [Full] (resp. [Rolling]) mode it controls the number of
    contexts (resp. blocks) we preserved behind the [checkpoint] (aka
    the no fork point). Default in sandbox mode is [2] and [5] for
    mainnet parameters (see [preserved_cycles] in the protocol
    parameters). *)
type history_mode = Archive | Full of int option | Rolling of int option

(** Values that can be passed to the node's [--media-type] argument *)
type media_type = Json | Binary | Any

(** Tezos node command-line arguments.

    Not all arguments are available here.
    Some are simply not implemented, and some are handled separately
    because they need special care. The latter are implemented as optional
    labeled arguments (e.g. [?net_port] and [?data_dir]).

    About [RPC_additional_addr], at least one RPC port is always passed by
    [Node.run], which causes the RPC ports from the configuration file to be
    ignored. So these arguments are not written in the config file when using
    [Node.init] and kept in the list of arguments of the persistent state to
    make sure [Node.run] passes them too.

    [Singleprocess] argument does not exist in the configuration file of the
    node. It is only known as a command-line option. [Node.init] will neither
    pass it to [Node.config] nor register it into node's arguments, but only
    use it for [Node.run] function.

(** This placeholder aims to handle the activation of the external RPC
    process for the Tezt nodes. Indeed, the external RPC process is an
    important feature that is not activated by default in the node and
    thus not tested on the CI. The tests on master are thus not
    testing the feature. To test the external RPC process anyway, a
    scheduled pipeline is launched every week, with the feature
    enabled, running all tests.
    When the scheduled pipeline is launched, the TZ_SCHEDULE_KIND
    environment variable is set to "EXTENDED_RPC_TESTS" to turn on the
    external RPC process. Look for the
    [ci/bin/custom_extended_test_pipeline.ml] file for more details. *)

(** This placeholder aims to handle the activation of the
    singleprocess validation for the Tezt nodes. Indeed, the
    singleprocess validation is an alternative way of validating
    blocks that is not activated by default in the node and thus not
    tested by the CI. The tests on master are thus not testing the
    feature. To test the singleprocess validation anyway, a scheduled

(** Create a node.

    This function just creates the [t] value, it does not call
    [identity_generate] nor [config_init] nor [run].

    The standard output and standard error output of the node will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [data_dir] is a temporary directory
    which is always the same for each [name].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file
    whose name is derived from [name]. It will be created
    as a named pipe so that node events can be received.

    Default value for [net_addr] is either [Constant.default_host] if no [runner] is
    provided, or a value allowing the local Tezt program to connect to it
    if it is.

    Default [rpc_external] is [false]. If [rpc_external] is [true],
    the node will spawn a process for non-blocking RPCs.

    Default values for [net_port] or [rpc_port] are chosen automatically
    with values starting from 16384 (configurable with `--starting-port`).
    They are used by [config_init]
    and by functions from the [Client] module. They are not used by [run],
    so if you do not call [config_init] or generate the configuration file
    through some other means, your node will not listen.

    Default value for [allow_all_rpc] is [true].

    Default value for [max_active_rpc_connections] is [500].

    [local_rpc_server] specify whether or not the RPC server must be
    run locally, if true (default), or on a external process. It is
    not allowed yet to run both server kinds at the same time.

    The argument list is a list of configuration options that the node
    should run with. It is passed to the first run of [octez-node config init].
    It is also passed to all runs of [octez-node run] that occur before
    [octez-node config init]. If [Expected_pow] is given, it is also used as
    the default value for {!identity_generate}.

    If [runner] is specified, the node will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH. *)

    value is wrong for instance right after a node restart or snapshot
    import. Therefore it is recommended to use the function {!get_level}

(** Initialize a node.

    This {!create}s a node, runs {!identity_generate}, {!config_init} and {!run},
    then waits for the node to be ready, and finally returns the node.

    Arguments are passed to {!config_init}. If you specified [Expected_pow],
    it is also passed to {!identity_generate}. Arguments are not passed to {!run}.
    If you do not wish the arguments to be stored in the configuration file
    (which will affect future runs too), do not use [init].

    When [patch_config] is provided, the function is used to patch the
    configuration file generated by {!config_init} before the call to
    {!run}. This argument should only be used to test configuration
    options that cannot be set with command-line {!argument}s.

    To import a snapshot before calling {!run}, specify
    [~snapshot:(file, do_reconstruct)], where file is the path to the snapshot.
    If [reconstruct] is [true], then [--reconstruct] is passed to the import
    command.

    The [env] argument, if specified, allows adding new environment
    variables when executing the [run] command of the octez-node. If
    any environment variable is already defined internally they
    will overwrite the ones provided via [env]. *)
