    The number for [Alpha] is the number it will have once snapshotted.

(** The value is the same as the one in src/proto_alpha/lib_parameters/default_parameters.ml. *)
val default_bootstrap_balance : int

(** Write a protocol parameter file.

    This function first builds a default parameter file from the [base]
    parameter. If [base] is a [string] {!Either.Left}, the string denotes a path
    to a parameter file like ["src/proto_alpha/parameters/sandbox-parameters.json"],
    which is taken as the base parameters. If [base] is a {!t * constants option} {!Either.Right},
    the default parameters of the given protocol are the base parameters.

    Then, the base parameters are tweaked with:
    - [bootstrap_accounts], when given these accounts are used instead of
      [Account.Bootstrap.keys]
    - [parameters_overrides]
    - [additional_bootstrap_accounts] is a list of bootstrap accounts to
      add to activation parameters. Each account is a triplet
      [(key, balance, revealed)]. If [revealed] the public key is added,
      else the public key hash is added. Revealed keys are expected to bake
      from the start. Default [balance] is 4000000 tez.
    - [bootstrap_smart_rollups] when given.
    - [bootstrap_contracts] when given.
    - [output_file] the path where to write the protocol parameter file,
      a [Temp.file] temporary file "parameters.json" by default.
*)

(** Get the predecessor of a protocol.

    WARNING: use of this function is discouraged, because it prevents the type-checker
    from telling you that your test can no longer run when removing a protocol. *)
val previous_protocol : t -> t option

(** Get the list of all protocols.

    WARNING: use of this function is discouraged, because:
    - if we add protocols such as demo-noop or demo-counter to type [t],
      it would be awkward to add them to [all] if [all] only contained "real" protocols
      up to now, and it would also be awkward not to add them to [all];
    - it is easier for maintainers if the list of protocols a test runs on is clearly
      defined where the test is registered. *)
val all : t list

(** Constraints on the set protocols that a test supports.

    Do not use this to decide which protocols the test should run on, this is the role
    of the last argument of [register_test] and [register_regression_test].
    Instead, declare what the test *could* run on.

    - [Any_protocol]: the test can run on all active protocols. This is the default.
    - [From_protocol n]: the test can run on protocols [p] such that [number p >= n].
    - [Until_protocol n]: the test can run on protocols [p] such that [number p <= n].
    - [Between_protocols (a, b)]: the test can run on protocols [p]
      such that [a <= number p <= b].
    - [Has_predecessor]: the test can run on protocols which have a predecessor
      according to [previous_protocol].
    - [And l]: all predicates of [l] hold.
    - [Or l]: at least one predicate of [l] hold.
    - [Not p]: predicate [p] does not hold.

    Always write the number itself, do not compute it.
    For instance, writing [Until_protocol (number Alpha)] would make your test
    not support the snapshotted version Alpha after Alpha is snapshotted,
    even though it actually does.

    It is recommended to write protocol numbers with leading zeros.
    For instance, write [From_protocol 008] instead of [From_protocol 8].*)
type supported_protocols =
  | Any_protocol
  | From_protocol of int
  | Until_protocol of int
  | Between_protocols of int * int
  | Has_predecessor
  | And of supported_protocols list
  | Or of supported_protocols list
  | Not of supported_protocols

(** Register a test that uses the protocol.

    This is the same as [Test.register] except that:
    - the name of the protocol is automatically added at the beginning of [title];
    - the name of the protocol is automatically added as a tag in [tags];
    - the function that implements the test takes a protocol as parameter;
    - an additional parameter gives the list of protocols to run the test on.

    The list of protocol is the last parameter because this function is intended
    to be applied partially, without this list; the test function being
    the parameter of type [t -> unit Lwt.t] before the list. The list of protocols is
    specified in [main.ml], next to the registration of all other tests, so that it
    is easy to see at a glance which tests run on which protocols.

    If your test involves several protocols (for instance to test migration),
    use [Test.register] directly. *)

(** Convert a function that expects two successive protocols
    into a function that expects only one.

    which does not have a predecessor. Use [~supports:Has_predecessor]
    to prevent this.
