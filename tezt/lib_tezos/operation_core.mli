(** This module can be used to craft an operation without using client
   dedicated commands.

    {1 Overview}

    This module aims to replace the module {!module:Operation_legacy}
   to provide an interface which is more extensible. In other words,
   supporting a new operation should be easier using this interface.

    An unsigned operation is represented by the datatype
   {!type:t}. {!type:t} is a wrapper around a JSON representation of
   an operation. Some meta information needs to be provided to sign
   this operation. {!type:t} is not signed a priori to ease writing
   tests with bad signatures.

    This module also provides two functions to ease the injection of
   an operation: {!val:inject} which should be called when the
   injection is expected to succeed, and {!val:inject_with_error} when
   the injection is expected to fail.

    Anyone is free to add support for new operations.


    {2 Manager operations}

    Manager operations represent most of the operations used by the
   tests. Those operations contain several parameters (see
   {!val:Manager.make}) and can be batched. Wrapper like
   {!val:Manager.inject} and {!val:Manager.inject_with_error} are
   provided to ease the writing of tests.

*)

(** The abstract representation of an unsigned operation. *)
type t

type operation := t

type consensus_kind = Attestation of {with_dal : bool} | Preattestation

(** The kind is necessary because it determines the watermark of an
   operation which is necessary for signing an operation. This type
   aims to be extended when other kinds of operations are added into
   this module. *)
type kind =
  | Consensus of {kind : consensus_kind; chain_id : string}
  | Anonymous
  | Voting

(** [make ~branch ?signer ~kind json client] builds the representation
   of an unsigned operation. *)
val make : branch:string -> ?signer:Account.key -> kind:kind -> JSON.u -> t

(** [json t] gives the json representation of an unsigned operation. *)
val json : t -> JSON.u

(** [hex ?(protocol=None) ?(signature=None) t client] computes the binary
    representation of an operation as a hexadecimal string. If [protocol] is
    given, the binary representation is computed using the encoding of operation
    from the [protocol]. Otherwise, a call to the [forge_operations] RPC is done
    to compute the binary representation. If [signature] is given, the
    hexadecimal represents the signed version of the operation. [client] is used
    to construct the binary representation of [t].

    @param protocol controls whether the encoding of a protocol should be used
    to compute the binary representation of the operation rather than calling
    the [forge_operations] RPC to compute it.

    @param signature controls whether a signature should be attached
    to the operation. *)
val hex :
  ?protocol:Protocol.t ->
  ?signature:Tezos_crypto.Signature.t ->
  t ->
  Client.t ->
  Hex.t Lwt.t

(** [sign t client] signs the raw representation of operation [t] by its signer
    (see {!val:make}). [client] is used to construct the binary representation
    of [t]. Note that if no signer have been given to [t] the function returns
    [Tezos_crypto.Signature.zero]. *)
val sign :
  ?protocol:Protocol.t -> t -> Client.t -> Tezos_crypto.Signature.t Lwt.t

(** [hash t client] returns the hash of the operation  *)
val hash : t -> Client.t -> [`OpHash of string] Lwt.t

(** Returns the size (in bytes) of the operation.

    @param protocol Allows using the operation encoding rather than
    using the [forge_operations] RPC to compute the hexadecimal
    representation of the operation.

    @param signature Allows to manually set the signature of the
    operation. When omitted, the operation is correctly signed using {!sign}. *)

(** [inject dont_wait ?(request=`Inject) ?(force=false) ?(signature=None)
   ?(error=None) t] injects an operation into the node. The node is
   extracted from the [Client]. If a node cannot be extracted, the
   injection fails. If the injection succeeds, the hash of the
   operation is returned.

   @param dont_wait If [true], the operation is injected without waiting
   on some node event. Making [request] ignore. Default is [false].

   @param request If [`Inject], we do not wait the [prevalidator] to
   classify the operation. This can create some flakyness in the test
   but is needed to test corner cases. If [`Notify], the function
   waits for the prevalidator to classify the operation. However, the
   nodes need to activate the debug events for the prevalidator.

   @param force If [true], the function succeeds even though the
   operation was classified with an error and was not propagated by
   the prevalidator. If [false], the call fails if the prevalidator
   classified the operation with an error.

   @param protocol Allow using the operation encoding rather than using the
   [forge_operations] RPC to compute the hexadecimal representation of the
   operations.

   @param signature Allows to give manually the signature of the
   operation. The operation is signed when the signature is omitted.

   @param error If the injection is expecting to fail, allows to
   specify the expected error.  *)

(** [inject_operations ?protocol ?request ?force ?error ?use_tmp_file ops
    client] is similar as [inject] for a list of operations. This function calls
    the RPC {!val:RPC.post_private_injection_operations} which is faster than
    calling the RPC used by {!val:inject} several times. Note that this function
    should be used mainly when the time for injecting operations matters.

    @param use_tmp_file see {!val:RPC.post_private_injection_operations} for
    more information. *)

   This json contains many more fields than the one produced by the
   {!json} function above.

   The operation is signed with {!Tezos_crypto.Signature.zero},
   because the [run_operation] RPC skips signature checks anyway.

   @param chain_id Allows to manually provide the [chain_id]. If
   omitted, the [chain_id] is retrieved via RPC using the provided
   [client].

   @param client The {!Client.t} argument is used to retrieve the
   [chain_id] when it is not provided. *)
