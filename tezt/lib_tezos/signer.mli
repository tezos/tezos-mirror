(** A signer instance *)
type t

(** Initialize a signer.

    This creates a signer, waits for it to be ready, and then returns it.

    The signer does not rely on a node for its initialization.
    While initializing the signer, we add a list of accounts [keys]
    that the signer is going to use for signing.

    We also pass the [uri] that the signer will use to answer signing
    calls.

    The standard output and standard error output of the signer will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that signer
    events can be received.

    The signer is configured to use its private base directory.

    If [runner] is specified, the signer will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.

    The allowed magic byte value for the signer can be specified with [magic_byte]. *)

    Usually you do not want to keep that in the final versions of your tests. *)

(** Same as [wait_for_full] but ignore metadata from the file descriptor sink.

    More precisely, [filter] is applied to the value of field
    ["fd-sink-item.v0"."event".<name>].

    If the node receives a JSON value that does not match the right
    JSON structure, it is not given to [filter] and the event is
    ignored. See [wait_for_full] to know what the JSON value must
    look like. *)

(** Raw events. *)
type event = {name : string; value : JSON.t; timestamp : float}

(** Add a callback to be called whenever the node emits an event.

    Contrary to [wait_for] functions, this callback is never removed.

    Listening to events with [on_event] will not prevent [wait_for] promises
    to be fulfilled. You can also have multiple [on_event] handlers, although
    the order in which they trigger is unspecified. *)
