 *)
val wait_for_ready : t -> unit Lwt.t

(** Spawn [octez-experimental-agnostic-baker run].

    The resulting promise is fulfilled as soon as the agnostic baker has been
    spawned. It continues running in the background. *)

(** Protocol status values. *)
type protocol_status = Active | Frozen | Ignore

(** Returns the protocol status given the full protocol value. *)
val protocol_status : Protocol.t -> protocol_status

(** Create a agnostic baker.

    This function just creates a value of type [t], it does not call {!val:run}.

    [path] provides the path to the agnostic baker binary, the default being the one
    derived from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the agnostic baker will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that agnostic baker
    events can be received.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the node used by the agnostic baker. The agnostic baker
    is configured to use the node's data dir.

    The [Client.t] parameter is the client used by the agnostic baker. The agnostic baker
    is configured to use the client's base directory.

    If [runner] is specified, the agnostic baker will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.

    [delegates] is a list of account aliases (see {!val:Account.key.alias}), e.g.,
    bootstrap accounts (see {!val:Constant.bootstrap_keys}), delegated to this
    agnostic baker. This defaults to the empty list, which is a shortcut for "every known
    account".

    [liquidity_baking_toggle_vote] is passed to the agnostic baker
    daemon through the flags [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]. If
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote] is [None], then
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote] is not passed. If it is [Some x]
    then [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote x] is passed. The default
    value is [Some Pass].

    [use_dal_node] is passed to the agnostic baker daemon through the
    [--without-dal] or [--dal-node <uri>] flags. If the flag is [None], the
    former option is passed, otherwise if the flag is [Some <uri>], then the
    latter option is passed. The default value is [None].

    If [remote_mode] is specified, the agnostic baker will run in RPC-only mode.

(** Similar to {!create}, but nodes RPCs addresses, wallet base directory and L1
    data directory are directly provided instead of a {!Client.t}, a {!Node.t}
    and optionally a {!Dal_node.t}.

    The [node_data_dir] parameter provides the (local) node's data directory
    used for baking.

    The [node_rpc_endpoint] parameter provides the (local) node's RPC server
    endpoint to which the agnostic baker will connect to.

    The [base_dir] parameter contains needed information about the wallets used
    by the agnostic baker.

(** Initialize an agnositc baker.

    This creates agnostic baker, waits for it to be ready, and then
    returns it.

    As the agnostic baker usually relies on a node, we first wait for
    the node to be ready and then, run the agnostic baker.

    The path to the agnostic baker binary is chosen from the
    [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the agnostic
    baker will be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that agnostic
    baker events can be received.

    agnostic baker is configured to use the node's data dir.

    baker. The agnostic baker is configured to use the client's base
