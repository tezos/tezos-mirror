(** Create a agnostic baker.

    This function just creates a value of type [t], it does not call {!val:run}.

    [path] provides the path to the agnostic baker binary, the default being the one
    derived from the [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the agnostic baker will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived
    from [name]. It will be created as a named pipe so that agnostic baker
    events can be received.

    The [Node.t] parameter is the node used by the agnostic baker. The agnostic baker
    is configured to use the node's data dir.

    The [Client.t] parameter is the client used by the agnostic baker. The agnostic baker
    is configured to use the client's base directory.

    If [runner] is specified, the agnostic baker will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH.

    [delegates] is a list of account aliases (see {!val:Account.key.alias}), e.g.,
    bootstrap accounts (see {!val:Constant.bootstrap_keys}), delegated to this
    agnostic baker. This defaults to the empty list, which is a shortcut for "every known
    account".

    [votefile], [force_apply_from_round], [operations_pool], [state_recorder],
    [node_version_check_bypass], [node_version_allowed] and [liquidity_baking_toggle_vote] are
    passed to the baker daemon through the flags [--votefile], [--force-apply-from-round],
    [--operations-pool], [--record-state], [--node-version-check-bypass], [--node-version-allowed]
    and [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]. If [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote]
    is [None], then [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote] is not passed. If it is [Some x] then
    [--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote x] is passed. The default value is [Some Pass].

    If [remote_mode] is specified, the agnostic baker will run in RPC-only mode.

    If a [dal_node_rpc_endpoint] is specified, then the baker queries it in
    order to determine the DAL content of the attestations it sends to the L1
    node.  *)

(** Similar to {!create}, but nodes RPCs addresses, wallet base directory and L1
    data directory are directly provided instead of a {!Client.t} and a {!Node.t}.

    The [node_data_dir] parameter provides the (local) node's data directory
    used for baking.

    The [node_rpc_endpoint] parameter provides the (local) node's RPC server
    endpoint to which the agnostic baker will connect to.

    The [base_dir] parameter contains needed information about the wallets used
    by the agnostic baker.

    If a [dal_node_rpc_endpoint] is specified, then the baker queries it in
    order to determine the DAL content of the attestations it sends to the L1
    node. *)

(** Initialize a protocol-agnostic baker.

    This creates agnostic baker, waits for it to be ready, and then
    returns it.

    As the agnostic baker usually relies on a node, we first wait for
    the node to be ready and then, run the agnostic baker.

    The path to the agnostic baker binary is chosen from the
    [protocol].

    The standard output and standard error output of the agnostic
    baker will be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file whose name is derived

    Show the baker daemon name, level and round of the block, and

    progress during a test. It can also be useful to observe baking
    rights at the levels and rounds featured in a test. *)
