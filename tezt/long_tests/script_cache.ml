   Component: cache
   Invocation: dune exec tezt/long_tests/main.exe -- cache
   Subject: Testing the script cache

   Most of the tests need to fill the cache, which takes ~2 minutes on a
   fast machine. This is why this test is in the "long test" category.
   If at some point the cache layout can be set through protocol parameters,
   then we may consider duplicating these tests in the CI too.

   FIXME: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/5620
   These test have disabled by adding the tag [ci_disabled] due to consistent failures.

   Testing proper handling of chain reorganizations
   ------------------------------------------------

   When a reorganization of the chain occurs, the cache must be
   backtracked to match the cache of the chosen head.

   Our testing strategy consists in looking at the evolution of a
   contract storage during a reorganization. Since contract storage is
   in the cache, this is an indirect way to check that the cache is
   consistent with the context.

   The test proceeds as follows:

   1. [divergence] creates two nodes [A] and [B]. One has a cache with
      a contract containing a string [s] while the other has a another
      head with a contract containing a string [u]. Node [B] has the
      longest chain, and thus its head will be chosen.

   2. [reorganize] triggers the resolution of the fork. Node [A] must
      backtrack on its cache.

   3. [check] validates that the contract now contains string [u].

   Testing efficiency of cache loading
