            other files. Long tests do not run on the CI but on a custom
            architecture which is particularly suited for performance regression tests.

   Each module defines tests which are thematically related,
   as functions to be called here. *)

(* Warning: Please, be sure this function is called at first before using
   any function from [Long_test] to avoid undesired behaviour regarding
   the loading of the configuration. *)
