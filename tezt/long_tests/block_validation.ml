*)

let team = Team.layer1

(** This module contains benchmarks that are used to prevent the regression
    of performance in the block validation processing.

    It works by running a node with the replay command on specific blocks
    or batch of blocks, using node events to extract the time taken by their
    validation.

    Each benchmark is run several times in a row to get a good approximation
    and reduce the noise induced by system calls, scheduling of Lwt, garbage
    collection, etc...

    In order to get reliable and consistent measurement between different
    executions, the same datadir should be provided to the launched node.
    Since the validation is run against specific blocks, this datadir must
    have been bootstrapped at level 1479022 with at least 10000 nodes of
    context history.

    The datadir must be present in the folder configured inside the
    field [test_data_path] or the performance regression framework
    configuration as:
    - A standard datadir folder named ["mainnet-1479022-hist-10000-datadir"]
    - A tar.gz archive named ["mainnet-1479022-hist-10000-datadir.tar.gz"]
    if the datadir folder could not be found. In this case, the module
    will first uncompress the archive before running the benchmarks. *)
