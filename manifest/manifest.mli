  (** S-expressions.

      S-expressions are lists of atoms and/or s-expressions.
      So basically we define the type of lists (with [] and ::), except that
      items can be lists themselves. By using [] and :: we get to use the list syntax.

      Constructor [S] is for atoms ([S] stands for [String]).

      Constructor [E] stands for "epsilon" or "empty".
      For instance, [[S "x"; E; S "y"]] is equivalent to [[S "x"; S "y"]].
      A typical use case is to insert expressions conditionally, for instance:
      [[S "x"; (if y then S "y" else E); S "z"]].

      Constructor [G] stands for "group".
      It is used to inline an s-expression (i.e. put all of its atoms inside the
      parent list without parentheses around those atoms).
      Additionally, those atoms are grouped together into a box when pretty-printing,
      so they can be put on a single line instead of each atom being put on its own line.

      Constructor [H] stands for "horizontal group".
      It is exactly the same as [G] except that the box enforces that atoms
      are not separated by newlines.

      Constructor [V] stands for "vertical group".
      It is exactly the same as [G] except that the box enforces that atoms
      are separated by newlines. *)
  type s_expr =

      - [language] is the foreign language of the stubs.
      - [flags] is a list of flags to pass on compilation, such as [-I] flags.
      - [include_dirs] is a list of directories where header files can be found.
      - [names] is the names of the stubs.

      This becomes a [(foreign_stubs (language ...) (flags ...) (include_dirs ...) (names ...))] stanza
      in the generated dune file. *)
  type foreign_stubs = {
    language : language;
    flags : s_expr;
    include_dirs : string list;
    names : string list;
  }

  (** Make an [alias] stanza.

      Example: [alias "abc"] results in [(alias (name abc))],
      and [alias "abc" ~deps:["x"; "y"]] results in [(alias (name abc) (deps x y))].

      Such stanzas are usually used to give a name (such as [abc]) to a set of targets,
      so that one can build all of those targets using [dune build @abc]. *)
  val alias : ?deps:string list -> string -> s_expr

  (** Make a [rule] stanza for an alias, of the form [(rule (alias ...) ...)].

      To specify dependencies, either use [deps] and [alias_deps], or [deps_dune].
      The former two are simpler to use since they expect strings, but sometimes
      you may need to specify complex stanzas, in which case you can use [deps_dune].

      - [deps] is a list of target files to build before this rule.
        It becomes a [deps] stanza.

      - [alias_deps] is a list of target aliases to build before this rule.
        They are added to the [deps] stanza in [alias] stanzas
        (resulting in [(deps (alias ...) ...)]).

      - [deps_dune] can be used to specify the arguments of the [deps] stanza
        directly as an s-expression instead.

      - [action] specifies the command to run when building this rule.
        It defaults to [(progn)], i.e. do nothing.
        Typically, actions can be built using {!run} or {!run_exe}.

      - [locks] specifies a path to lock when running this rule.
        Other rules that require the same locks will not be run in parallel.
        Different paths may denote the same lock (e.g. [./x] and [x]),
        but paths do not denote actual files: files are not actually created.

      - [package] specifies the opam package in which this rule belong.
        This is important in particular for [runtest] rules, so that dune knows
        which tests to run when opam runs the tests for a package.

      - [enabled_if] specifies the Dune [enabled_if] clause of this rule.

      The last [string] argument is the name of the alias.
      For instance, if this name is [abc], you can build the rule with [dune build @abc]. *)
  val alias_rule :
    ?deps:string list ->
    ?alias_deps:string list ->
    ?deps_dune:s_expr ->
    ?action:s_expr ->
    ?locks:string ->
    ?package:string ->
    ?enabled_if:s_expr ->
    string ->
    s_expr

  (** Make a stanza of the form [(run ...)].

      Example: [run "%{gen}" ["%{targets}"]] results in [(run %{gen} %{targets})].

      Such stanzas are typically used in [action] parameters of {!alias_rule}. *)
  val run : string -> string list -> s_expr

  (** Make a stanza of the form [(run %{exe:....exe} ...)].

      Example: [run_exe "main" ["-v"; "x.txt"]]
      results in [(run %{exe:main.exe} -v x.txt)]. *)
  val run_exe : string -> string list -> s_expr

  (** Make a [setenv] stanza.

      Example: [setenv "HOME" "/tmp" (run_exe "test" [])] results in
      [(setenv HOME /tmp (run %{exe:test.exe}))].

      This causes the executed command to be run with [HOME=/tmp] in its environment. *)
  val setenv : string -> string -> s_expr -> s_expr

  (** Make a [progn] user action construction, which allows executing more than
      one command.

      Example:
        [~action:(progn [run_exe "main"; [S "diff?"; S "expected"; S "output"];])]
      results in
        [(action (progn (run %{exe:main.exe}) (diff? expected output)))]
  *)
  val progn : s_expr list -> s_expr

  (** Make a [(chdir %{workspace_root} ...)] stanza.

      Such stanzas are typically used to wrap [run] stanzas (e.g. built with {!run_exe})
      to make them run in the root directory of workspace.

      Example: [chdir_workspace_root (run_exe "test" [])] results in
      [(chdir %{workspace_root} (run %{exe:test.exe}))]. *)
  val chdir_workspace_root : s_expr -> s_expr

  (** Make an [ocamllex] stanza.

      Example: [ocamllex "lexer"] results in [(ocamllex lexer)], which tells dune
      that [lexer.ml] can be obtained from [lexer.mll] using ocamllex. *)
  val ocamllex : string -> s_expr

  (** Make an [ocamlyacc] stanza.

      Example: [ocamlyacc "parser"] results in [(ocamlyacc parser)], which tells dune
      that [parser.ml] and [parser.mli] can be obtained from [parser.mly] using ocamlyacc. *)
  val ocamlyacc : string -> s_expr

  (** Make a [menhir] stanza.

      Example: [menhir "parser"] results in [(menhir (modules parser))], which tells dune
      that [parser.ml] and [parser.mli] can be obtained from [parser.mly] using menhir. *)
  val menhir : string -> s_expr

  (** Make an [include] stanza.

      Example: [include_ "rules.inc"] results in [(include rules.inc)].

      Such stanzas are used at toplevel to include other dune files. *)
  val include_ : string -> s_expr

  type target_mode = Default | Fallback | Promote

  (** Makes a rule stanza to generate targets.

      Example: [targets_rule ?deps targets ~action] results in:

      (rule
        (targets <targets>)
        (deps <deps>)
        (action <action>))

      Set the optional argument [~mode] to true to generate
      a [(mode <MODE>)] stanza.
  *)
  val targets_rule :
    ?mode:target_mode ->
    ?deps:s_expr list ->
    ?enabled_if:s_expr ->
    string list ->
    action:s_expr ->
    s_expr

  (** Same as [targets_rule] but for a single target *)
  val target_rule :
    ?mode:target_mode ->
    ?deps:s_expr list ->
    ?enabled_if:s_expr ->
    string ->
    action:s_expr ->
    s_expr

  (** Makes a rule for compiling protobuf files (.proto) into OCaml files (.ml). *)
  val protobuf_rule : string -> s_expr

  (** Makes an [install] stanza.

      Example: [install files ~package ~section] creates a stanza of the form:

      [(install
        (package <package>)
        (section <section>)
        (files <files>))] *)
  val install : ?package:string -> s_expr list -> section:string -> s_expr

  (** Makes an [as] expression.

      Example: [as_ "foo" "bar"] results in [(foo as bar)] *)
  val as_ : string -> string -> s_expr
end

module Version : sig
  (** Opam package versions and version constraints. *)

  (** Opam package versions.

      Example: ["1.1.0"] *)
  type t = string

  (** Atoms of Opam package versions.

      [V] is a regular version number, and [Version] is Opam's [version] variable
      which denotes the version of the current package. *)
  type atom = V of t | Version

  (** Opam package version constraints.

      - [True] means no constraint.

      - [False] means the package cannot be installed.
        Opam does not actually support this constructor and trying to
        write an opam package with such a version constraint results in an error.
        This constructor is provided for completeness sake so that
        functions {!not_}, {!and_list} and {!or_list} can be more general.

      - [Exactly v] means that the version number must be [v].
        It becomes [=] in the generated opam file.

      - [Different_from v] means that the version number cannot be [v].
        It becomes [!=] in the generated opam file.

      - [At_least v] means that the version number must be [v] or more.
        It becomes [>=] in the generated opam file.

      - [More_than v] means that the version number must be greater than [v].
        In particular it cannot be [v].
        It becomes [>] in the generated opam file.

      - [At_most v] means that the version number must be [v] or less.
        It becomes [<=] in the generated opam file.

      - [Less_than v] means that the version number must be lower than [v].
        In particular it cannot be [v].
        It becomes [<] in the generated opam file.

      - [Not a] is the negation of constraint [a].
        It becomes [! (...)] in the generated opam file.
        It is advised to use {!not_} instead.

      - [And (a, b)] is the conjunction of [a] and [b].
        It becomes [&] in the generated opam file.
        It is advised to use {!and_} or {and_list} instead.

      - [Or (a, b)] is the disjunction of [a] and [b].
        It becomes [|] in the generated opam file.
        It is advised to use {!or_} or {or_list} instead. *)

  (** Smart constructor for [Not].

      Simple terms are converted without using [Not].
      For instance [not_ True] is [False] and [not_ (At_most x)] is [More_than x].
      [not_ (Not x)] is [x]. Only [And] and [Or] result in an actual [Not], i.e.
      [not_ (And ...)] is [Not (And ...)]. *)

  (** Smart constructor for [And].

      Conjunctions between [x] and [True] return [x] instead of [And (x, True)],

  (** Same as [List.fold_left and_ True]. *)
  val and_list : constraints list -> constraints

  (** Smart constructor for [Or].

end

(** Module lists for the [(modules)] stanza in [dune] files.

    - [All] means "all modules of the current directory".
      This is the default.

    - [Modules] means "exactly this list of modules".
      Use this for directories which contain several libraries, executables or tests,
      to specify which modules are used by which targets.

    - [All_modules_except] can be used to express the set difference of
      [All] and [Modules]. Use this if you just want to exclude some files.

    For most cases [All] is strongly recommended.
    If you are tempted to explicitly list modules, consider splitting
    your files in subdirectories instead. One exception is if you need to
    be extra sure on which modules are available. Even then, it is recommended
    to not put extra source files in the same directory. *)
type modules =
  | All
  | Modules of string list
  | All_modules_except of string list

(** Preprocessor dependencies.

    - [File]: becomes a [(preprocessor_deps (file ...))] stanza in the [dune] file. *)
type preprocessor_dep =
  | File of string
  | Glob_files of string
  | Env_var of string

(** Target descriptions.

    Targets can be external or internal.
    External targets are dependencies that are not part of the project
    and for which no [dune] and [.opam] file need to be generated.
    They can be defined anyway, using e.g. [external_lib], so that internal
    targets can declare that they need them.

    Internal targets are libraries (public or private), executables (public or private)
    and tests that are defined in your [dune] files and packaged in your [.opam] files.
    These are the main values you want to define; everything else is only a tool to
    define internal targets. From those internal target descriptions, [dune] and [.opam]
    files can be generated.

    Each internal target corresponds to part of a [dune] file, and optionally to
    one [.opam] file. The [dune] file is located in the directory specified by
    the [path] argument that is given to the function used to declare the target.
    The full path of the [.opam] file is specified by the [opam] argument,
    to which extension [.opam] is appended.

    Note that several internal targets may use the same [path],
    in which case all of them will be put in the same [dune] file.
    Similarly, several internal targets may use the same [opam] path,
    in which case all of them will be considered part of this same opam package.
    Alternatively, targets for the same [path] file can have different [opam] paths.
    This means that you can have one [dune] file corresponding to several [.opam] files,
    or one [.opam] file with several [dune] files, or any other combinations. *)
type target

(** A target that is ignored when it appears in lists given to target [maker]s.

    [no_target] can be used in dependency lists, i.e. in [?deps], [?conflicts]
    and [?opam_only_deps]. [no_target] is removed from those lists automatically.
    It can thus be used to conveniently build target lists where some targets
    are computed programatically and may not always be included.

    [optional no_target], [select ~package:no_target ...] and [open_ no_target]
    are equivalent to [no_target].

(** Whether to add the [dune runtest] command in the [.opam] file.

    - [Never]: do not add it.
    - [Always]: add it with [{with-test}].
    - [Only_on_64_arch]: add it with [{with-test & ARCH}]
      where [ARCH] is a condition that only holds on 64-bit architectures. *)
type with_test = Always | Never | Only_on_64_arch

(** Release status for internal targets.

    The semantics of release statuses is summed up in this table:

    |                       | Unreleased | Experimental | Released | Auto_opam |
    |-----------------------+------------+--------------+----------+-----------|
    | make experimental     | no         | yes          | yes      | no        |
    | docker (master)       | no         | yes          | yes      | no        |
    | static (master)       | no         | yes          | yes      | no        |
    | make                  | no         | no           | yes      | no        |
    | docker (release tag)) | no         | no           | yes      | no        |
    | static (release tag)  | no         | no           | yes      | no        |
    | opam (release tag)    | no         | no           | yes      | if needed |

    [Unreleased] means: never release.

    [Experimental] means: release for [master], but not for release tags.
    Since opam packages are not released for [master], they are never published
    for experimental targets. However, [make experimental] builds public executables
    and those executables are put in Docker images and made available as static
    executables for [master].

    [Released] means: release both for [master] and release tags.
    Opam packages of released targets are published when making release tags.
    [make] builds released public executables and those executables are put in
    Docker images and made available as static executables, both for [master]
    and release tags.

    [Auto_opam] means: only release opam package, and only if needed.
    The opam package is released if:
    - one of its targets is released;
    - or it is a transitive dependency of another released opam package.

    Note that a given opam package cannot be both published and not published.
    This means that it is not possible to have an [Unreleased] or [Experimental]
    target in the same package as a [Released] target. It is also not possible
    for a target to be [Unreleased] or [Experimental] if it is in an opam package
    which is needed as a transitive dependency of a [Released] target. *)
type release_status = Unreleased | Experimental | Released | Auto_opam

(** Configure [bisect_ppx] instrumentation.

    If [No], disable instrumentation. If [Yes], enable
    instrumentation. If [With_sigterm], enable instrumentation and
    install a sigterm handler. See {!maker} for more details. *)
type bisect_ppx = No | Yes | With_sigterm

(** Functions that build internal targets.

    The ['a] argument is instantiated by the relevant type for the name(s)
    of the target.

    - [all_modules_except]: short-hand for [~modules: (All_module_except ...)].

    - [bisect_ppx]: if [Yes] (respectively [With_sigterm]), the target's [dune] file
      is generated with [(instrumentation (backend bisect_ppx))] (respectively
      [(instrumentation (backend bisect_ppx --bisect-sigterm))]) for this target.
      This makes it possible to compute coverage. It is recommended to set this
      to [Yes] for all libraries and executables except those that are only used for tests
      (and thus are never run by users). It should be set to [With_sigterm] for test
      executables that spawn sub-processes which are susceptible to termination
      through sigterm in non-exceptional circumstances (e.g. Tezt entrypoints).

    - [time_measurement_ppx]: if [true], the target's [dune] file is generated
      with [(instrumentation (backend time_measurement_ppx))] for this target.
      This makes it possible to add time measurement tooling for the target.

    - [c_library_flags]: specifies a [(c_library_flags ...)] stanza.
      Those flags are passed to the C compiler when constructing the library archive
      for the foreign stubs.

    - [conflicts]: a list of target; all of their packages will be put in the
      [conflicts] section of the [.opam] file.

    - [dep_files]: a list of files to add as dependencies using [(deps (file ...))]
      in the [runtest] alias.

    - [dep_globs]: a list of files to add as dependencies using [(deps (glob_files ...))]
      in the [dune] file.

    - [dep_globs_rec]: a list of files to add as dependencies using [(deps (glob_files_rec ...))]
      in the [dune] file.

    - [deps]: a list of targets to add as dependencies using [(libraries)]
      in the [dune] file.

    - [dune]: added to the [dune] file after this target.
      A typical use is to add [rule] or [install] stanzas.

    - [flags]: specifies a [(flags ...)] stanza.
      Those flags are passed to the OCaml compiler when compiling and linking OCaml units.

    - [foreign_archives]: specifies a [(foreign_archives)] stanza for the [dune] target.

    - [foreign_stubs]: specifies a [(foreign_stubs)] stanza for the [dune] target.

    - [implements]: specifies an [(implements)] stanza for the [dune] target.

    - [inline_tests]: specifies an inline_tests backend. Can only be used when constructing a library.
      If used, will add [(inline_tests)] and the corresponding preprocessor in the dune stanza.

    - [inline_tests_deps]: specifies inline_tests dependencies. Can only be used when constructing
      a library with inline_tests enabled.

    - [wrapped]: specifies a [(wrapped ...)] stanza for the [dune] target.

    - [documentation]: specifies a [(documentation ...)] stanza for the [dune]
      target where [...] is the value of the parameter. Use this parameter if
      the library includes an [index.mld] file.

    - [link_flags]: specifies a [(link_flags ...)] stanza. This argument is merged with the other
      ones affecting [(link_flags ...)] stanza.

    - [linkall]: if [true], add [-linkall] to the list of flags to be passed
      to the OCaml compiler. In executables and tests, it is added to the [(link_flags ...)]
      stanza, causing all modules of all dependencies to be linked unconditionally,
      even if they are not referenced directly in the code.
      In libraries, it is added to the [(library_flags ...)] stanza,
      causing all modules of the library to be linked unconditionally when the
      library is used as a dependency of an executable or test.

    - [modes]: list of modes this target can be compiled to.

    - [modules]: list of modules to include in this target.

    - [modules_without_implementation]: list of modules without implementation to include in this target.

    - [ocaml]: constraints for the version of the [ocaml] opam package,
      i.e. on the version of the OCaml compiler.

    - [opam]: path and name of the [.opam] file, without the [.opam] extension.
      If [""], no [.opam] file is generated for this target.
      If unspecified, for public libraries and executables a default value of
      [path/name] is used, where [path] is the path of the [dune] file
      and [name] is the public name of the target.
      For private libraries, private executables and tests, you must specify
      this argument (you can explicitely set it to [""] to generate no [.opam] file).

    - [opam_bug_reports], [opam_doc] and [opam_homepage]: URLs to put in the [.opam] file
      in the [bug-reports], [doc] and [homepage] clauses respectively.
      Clauses are omitted for empty strings.
      You usually do not want to specify those and keep default values,
      but there can be some exceptions for packages that are particularly useful
      on their own outside of Octez.

    - [opam_with_test]: whether to add the [dune runtest] command.
      Note that for a given package all targets must have the same value of [opam_with_test].

    - [opam_version]: the version of the opam package.
      This is only useful for releasing different products that depend on each-other.

    - [path]: path of the directory in which to generate the [dune] file for this target.

    - [ppx_kind]: specifies a [(kind ppx_rewriter)] or [(kind ppx_deriver)]
      stanza for the [dune] target. Must be set when the library is intended
      to be used as a PPX rewriter or a [@@deriving ...] plugin.

    - [ppx_runtime_libraries]: adds a [(ppx_runtime_libraries ...)]
      stanza to the [dune] target, allowing to specify runtime
      dependencies when the library is a [ppx_rewriter] or a [ppx_deriver].

    - [preprocess]: preprocessor directives to add using the [(preprocess ...)] stanza.
      Those preprocessors are also added as dependencies in the [.opam] file.

    - [preprocessor_deps]: preprocessor dependencies.

    - [private_modules]: similar to [modules], but those modules are not part of the
      library interface. They are not part of the toplevel module of the library.

    - [profile]: the name of the profile to which the target belongs.
      For each profile, a file [opam/virtual/<PROFILE_NAME>.opam] is generated.
      This file depends on all external dependencies on which targets that belong
      to this profile depend on, and contains no build instructions.
      It is thus a good basis for [opam lock] to generate a [<PROFILE_NAME>.opam.locked] file.
      Running [opam install <PROFILE_NAME>.opam.locked] will then install all dependencies
      needed to build targets belonging to this profile.

      Targets for which no profile is specified will belong to the default profile
      given to {!generate}. Most of the time you do not need to specify a profile:
      the default profile is fine. But if your target depends on packages that users
      would most likely not want to install, it may be a good idea to separate it
      into its own profile.

    - [opam_only_deps]: dependencies to add to the [.opam] file but not to the [dune] file.
      Typical use cases are runtime dependencies and build dependencies for users
      of the target (but not the target itself).

    - [optional]: if [true], do not build this target if some of its dependencies
      are not available. The dependencies of this target themselves become optional
      dependencies in the [.opam] file (unless they are required by other targets).
      Default is [false].

    - [release_status]: if and when this should be released.
      See the documentation of type {!release_status}.
      Default value is [Auto_opam].

    - [static]: whether to incluce [ %{workspace_root}/static-link-flags.sexp ] to the link
      flags to provide a static compilation profile.
      Default is [true] for public executables and [false] for other targets.

    - [synopsis]: short description for the [.opam] file.

    - [description]: long description for the [.opam] file.

    - [virtual_modules]: similar to [modules], but for modules that should have an
      implementation (an [.ml] file) but that have not. Those modules only come
      with an [.mli]. This turns the target into a virtual target.
      Other targets can declare that they implement those modules with [implements].

    - [default_implementation] specifies a [(default_implementation)] stanza for the
      [dune] target. Note that this argument has type [string] instead of type [target].
      The user should give the name of e.g. the public library that serves as default
      implementation.

    - [license]: specific license to use for that target. If omitted it will
      default to MIT.

    - [extra_authors]: list of authors in addition to the Tezos Dev Team.

    - [path]: the path to the directory of the [dune] file that will define this target.

    - [with_macos_security_framework]: Default value is [false]. When set to
      [true], the [-ccopt "-framework Security"]flag is added at link time for
      macOS system. *)

(** Register a Tezt test.

    Usage: [tezt module_names]

    This declares:
    - a library [PACKAGE_tezt_lib] in [path] where [PACKAGE] is the name of the
      opam package denoted by [opam];
    - an executable [main] in [path] that links with [PACKAGE_tezt_lib]
      and runs [Tezt.Test.run].

    [module_names] is the list of modules to link in [PACKAGE_tezt_lib].
    Those should be files in [path] that call [Tezt.Test.register].

    Note that a wrapper in [main.ml] adds a dependency to the [tezt] library
    and [-open]s modules [Tezt] and [Tezt.Base] when compiling [module_names].

    Additionally, the library [PACKAGE_tezt_lib] is also linked in [tezt/tests/main.exe]
    so that this executable can be used to run all tests with auto-balancing
    and other Tezt features.

    The flag [with_macos_security_framework] has a default [false]. When set to
    [true], the [-ccopt "-framework Security"]flag is added at link time for
    macOS system.

    The function returns a target that is the local library created by tezt

    to share code with other targets. *)

(** Make an external vendored library, for use in internal target dependencies.

    [main_module] is the name of the main module provided by the library (see [open_]).

    [released_on_opam]: whether the library is available on the upstream opam-repository
    (default true). In case the lib is not available on opam, tezos packages depending
    on it won't be installable on opam.

    Version constraints are only added to released [.opam] files
    (i.e. when running the manifest with [--release]).
    And when appearing in [~conflicts], vendored libraries are only added to released
    [.opam] files. The idea is that vendored libraries are compiled from the local copy,
    so version and conflicts do not matter, except when installing with [opam install],
    in which case local copies are ignored and vendored libraries are installed through
    opam. This is because we [rm -r vendors] in [.opam] files because of a bug of dune
    when multiple layers of vendored libraries are involved. *)

(** Make an external library, for use in internal target dependencies.

    Usage: [external_lib name version_constraints]

    [name] is used in [dune] files, while [opam] is used in [.opam] files.
    Default value for [opam] is [name].

    [main_module] is the name of the main module provided by the library (see [open_]).

val external_lib :

(** Make an external library that is a sublibrary of an other one.

    Usage: [external_sublib main_lib name]

    If [main_lib]'s [opam] is [main_opam] and its version constaints are
    [version_constraints], this is equivalent to:
    [external_lib ~opam: main_opam name version_constraints].

    [main_module] is the name of the main module provided by the library (see [open_]).
    The main module of [main_lib] is ignored.

    @raise Invalid_arg if [main_lib] was not built with [external_lib]. *)
val external_sublib : ?main_module:string -> target -> string -> target

(** Make an external library that is to only appear in [.opam] dependencies.

    This avoids using [~opam_only_deps] each time you declare this dependency.

    [can_vendor] specifies whether opam-monorepo should vendor this dependency, defaults
    to [true]. *)
val opam_only : ?can_vendor:bool -> string -> Version.constraints -> target

(** Make an optional dependency with a source file to be selected depending on presence.

    In the [dune] file, this corresponds to a stanza of the form:
    [(select target from (package -> source_if_present) (-> source_if_absent))]
    where [package] is the opam package of the [package] target.

    This tells Dune that if [package] is present, it should be used to compile
    and link, and that [source_if_present] should be used in place of [target],
    while [source_if_absent] should be ignored. On the opposite, if [package] is
    absent, the target can still be compiled, but [package] should not be used
    to compile and link (obviously), and [source_if_absent] should be used in
    place of [target], while [source_if_absent] should be ignored.

    For instance,
    {[
      select
        ~package:"p"
        ~source_if_present:"x.available.ml"
        ~source_if_absent:"x.none.ml"
        "x.ml"
    }]
    corresponds to:
    {[
      (select x.ml from
         (p -> x.available.ml)
         (-> x.none.ml))
    ]}
    and means: if package [p] is installed, compile with [x.ml] equal to [x.available.ml],
    else compile with [x.ml] equal to [x.none.ml]. File [x.none.ml] con for instance
    contain a dummy implementation.

    The target is put in the [depopts] section instead of the [depends] section
    of the [.opam] file. *)
val select :
  package:target ->
  source_if_present:string ->
  source_if_absent:string ->
  target:string ->
  target

(** Make an optional dependency, to be linked only if available.

    [optional] is a simplified version of [select]: [optional p] corresponds to
    [[
      (select void_for_linking-p from
       (p -> void_for_linking-p.empty)
       (-> void_for_linking-p.empty))
    ]]
    i.e. if [p] is available, it is linked, and if not, it is not linked.

    Depending on an [optional] target also adds a Dune rule of the form
    [(rule (action progn (write-file void_for_linking-p.empty "")))].
    [void_for_linking-p] is a dummy file created in both cases of the [(select)]
    from the empty file [void_for_linking-p.empty] which is generated automatically
    thanks to this rule.

    Like [select], the target is put in the [depopts] section of the [.opam] file
    instead of the [depends] section. *)
val optional : target -> target

(** Make a target with a module that should automatically be opened.

    If [m] is specified, open this submodule instead of the main module.

    When such targets appear in [?deps] of a target [maker], they are
    converted into [-open] in the order of declaration in [?deps].
    If you use [open_] on an [open_], the innermost [open_]s is opened first;
    For instance, [tezos_base |> open_ |> open_ ~m: "TzPervasives"]
    is target [tezos_base], but when used in [?deps], this automatically opens
    ["Tezos_base"], followed by ["Tezos_base.TzPervasives"].

    Can only be used on internal libraries and on external or vendored
    libraries for which a [main_module] was specified. *)
val open_ : ?m:string -> target -> target

  (** Register and return an internal test.

    - [alias]: if non-empty, an alias is set up for the given test, named [alias].
      Default is ["runtest"].
      Note that if [alias] is non-empty, the target must belong to an opam package
      (i.e. [~opam] must also be non-empty). If given, the [enabled_if] and/or [locks]
      clauses are added to this alias.

    - [dune_with_test]: Specifies a condition for the test to be run on the dune file.
      If set to [Only_on_64_arch], [%{arch_sixtyfour}] is added to the [enabled_if] clause.
      If set to [Always], nothing is added to the [enabled_if] clause.
      If set to [Never], [false] is added to the [enabled_if] clause.

    - [enabled_if]: add a custom [enabled_if] clause. If both [dune_with_test] and
      [enabled_if] are set, then logically, the resulting clause is the conjunction
      of the two (i.e. [(and <enabled_if> <dune_with_test>)])

    - [action]: replace the default action. If omitted, the action is
      to run the test executable.

    Since tests are private, they have no public name: the ['a]
    argument of [maker] is the internal name. *)

(** Generate dune and opam files.

    Call this after you declared all your targets with functions such as
    [public_lib], [test], etc.

    [make_tezt_exe] is given the list of libraries that register Tezt tests
    and shall create a test executable that links all of them.

    [tezt_exe_deps] is the list of dependencies linked with the executable
    registered by [make_tezt_exe], not including the libraries that were passed
    to [make_tezt_exe]. It is the list of dependencies that should trigger
    all tests to run when they are modified.

    [default_profile] is the name of the profile to use for targets that
    were declared without [?profile]. See the documentation of the [?profile]
    argument of type ['a maker].

    Some checks are performed before generating:

    - Check that there are no circular dependencies of opam packages.
      If this check is not performed before [generate], generation may cause
      a stack overflow.

    - Check that all targets of an opam package contain the same value for
      [~opam_with_test]. *)

    - Check that all [dune], [dune-project], [dune-workspace] and [.opam] files
      are either generated or excluded. It is an error if a generated file is excluded.
      You can use [exclude] to specify which files should be excluded.
      [exclude] is given a path relative to the [root] directory
      and shall return [true] for excluded paths.

    In case of errors, errors are printed and the process exits with exit code 1. *)
val postcheck : ?exclude:(string -> bool) -> unit -> unit

(** Generate dune-workspace file.

    [generate_workspace env dune] will generate a dune-workspace file at the root of the repo.
    [env] will translate into the corresponding env stanza.
    [dune] is a free form s-expression that will be included as is at the end of the file.

(** [write filename f] writes a file relatively to the root directory of the repository.
