    description of each of the available type and combinator exported by the
    data-encoding library.

(** {1 Data Encoding} *)

(** {2 Overview}

    This module provides type-safe serialization and deserialization of
    data structures. Backends are provided to both /ad hoc/ binary, JSON
    and BSON.

    This works by writing type descriptors by hand, using the provided
    combinators. These combinators can fine-tune the binary
    representation to be compact and efficient, but also provide
    proper field names and meta information. As a result, an API that uses
    those descriptors can be automatically introspected and documented.

    Here is an example encoding for type [(int * string)].

    [let enc = obj2 (req "code" uint16) (req "message" string)]

    In JSON, this encoding maps values of type [int * string] to JSON
    objects with a field [code] whose value is a number and a field
    [message] whose value is a string.

    In binary, this encoding maps to two raw bytes for the [int]
    followed by the size of the string in bytes, and finally the raw
    contents of the string. This binary format is mostly tagless,
    meaning that serialized data cannot be interpreted without the
    encoding that was used for serialization.

    Regarding binary serialization, encodings are classified as either:
    - fixed size (booleans, integers, numbers)
      data is always the same size for that type ;
    - dynamically sized (arbitrary strings and bytes)
      data is of unknown size and requires an explicit length field ;
    - variable size (special case of strings, bytes, and arrays)
      data makes up the remainder of an object of known size,
      thus its size is given by the context, and does not
      have to be serialized.

    JSON operations are delegated to [json-data-encoding]. *)

(** {2 Module structure}

    This [Data_encoding] module provides multiple submodules:
    - {!Encoding} contains the necessary types and constructors for making the
    type descriptors.
    - {!Json}, {!Bson}, and {!Binary} contain functions to serialize and
    deserialize values.

*)

module Encoding : sig
  (** The type descriptors for values of type ['a]. *)
  type 'a t = 'a Encoding.t

  type 'a encoding = 'a t

  type string_json_repr = Hex | Plain

  (** {3 Ground descriptors} *)

  (** {4 voids} *)

  (** Special value [null] in JSON, nothing in binary. *)
  val null : unit encoding

  (** Empty object (not included in binary, encoded as empty object in JSON). *)
  val empty : unit encoding

  (** Unit value, omitted in binary.
      Serialized as an empty object in JSON, accepts any object when deserializing. *)
  val unit : unit encoding

  (** Constant string (data is not included in the binary data). *)
  val constant : string -> unit encoding

  (** {4 ground numerical types}

      All encodings are big-endians.

      - 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned) are encoded over 1 single byte.
      - 16-bit integers (signed or unsigned) are encoded over 2 bytes.
      - 31-bit integers are always signed and always encoded over 4 bytes.
      - 32-bit integers are always signed and always encoded over 4 bytes.
      - 64-bit integers are always signed and always encoded over 8 bytes.

      A note on 31-bit integers. The internal representation of integers in
      OCaml reserves one bit for GC tagging. The remaining bits encode a signed
      integer. For compatibility with 32-bit machine, we restrict these native
      integers to the 31-bit range. *)

      @raise Invalid_argument if the bounds are beyond the interval
      [-2^30; 2^30-1]. These bounds are chosen to be compatible with all versions
      of OCaml.

  end

  (** Big number

      In JSON, data is encoded as a string containing the decimal representation
      of the number.

      In binary, data is encoded as a variable length sequence of
      bytes, with a running unary size bit: the most significant bit of
      each byte tells is this is the last byte in the sequence (0) or if
      there is more to read (1). The second most significant bit of the
      first byte is reserved for the sign (positive if zero). Sizing and
      sign bits ignored, data is then the binary representation of the
      absolute value of the number in little-endian order. *)
  val z : Z.t encoding

  (** Positive big number.

      In JSON, data is encoded as a string containing the decimal representation
      of the number.

      In binary, data is encoded similarly to [z] but the sign bit is omitted.
      In other words:

      Data is encoded as a variable length sequence of bytes, with a running
      unary size bit: the most significant bit of each byte tells is this is the
      last byte in the sequence (0) or if there is more to read (1).
      Sizing bits ignored, data is then the binary representation of the
      number in little-endian order. *)
  val n : Z.t encoding

  (** [uint_like_n ()] is an encoding for [int] which uses the same representation
      as {!n}.

      For compatibility with 32-bit machines, this encoding supports the same
      range of encodings as [int31], but only the positive ones. I.e., it
      supports the inclusive range [0] to [(1 lsl 30) - 1].

      The optional parameter [?max_value] can be used to further restrict the
      range of values. If [max_value] is set and is greater than
      [(1 lsl 30) - 1] then the function raises [Invalid_argument].

      The encoding is partial: attempting to de/serialise values which are
      outside of the supported range will fail. In addition, in binary, a
      maximum size for the serialised representation is computed based on the
      maximum value in the range, and the de/serialisation process fails before
      attempting any conversion if the size is exceeded.

      @raise Invalid_argument if [max_value < 0] or
      [max_value > (1 lsl 30) - 1] *)
  val uint_like_n : ?max_value:int -> unit -> int encoding

  (** [int_like_z ()] is an encoding for [int] which uses the same representation
      as {!z}.

      For compatibility with 32-bit machines, this encoding supports the same
      range of encodings as [int31]. I.e., it supports the inclusive range
      [-(1 lsl 30)] to [(1 lsl 30) - 1].

      The optional parameters [?min_value] and [?max_value] can be used to
      further restrict the
      range of values. If [min_value] is set and less than [-(1 lsl 30)] or if
      [max_value] is set and is greater than [(1 lsl 30) - 1] then the function
      raises [Invalid_argument].

      The encoding is partial: attempting to de/serialise values which are
      outside of the supported range will fail. In addition, in binary, a
      maximum size for the serialised representation is computed based on the
      encoding's range, and the de/serialisation process fails before attempting
      any conversion if the size is exceeded.

      @raise Invalid_argument if [max_value < min_value]

      (represented as a 1-byte tag followed by the data (or nothing) in binary
       and either the raw value or a null in JSON).

      Note that the JSON representation is only weakly discriminating.
      Specifically, the value [Some None] is represented as the raw value [None]
      and so the two are indistinguishable. For this reason, this combinator
      does not support nesting, nor does it support use within a recursive
      ({!mu}) encoding.

      @raise Invalid_argument if called on an encoding which may be represented
      as [null] in JSON. This includes an encoding of the form [option _],
      [conv _ _ (option _)], [dynamic_size (option _)], etc.

     raise [No_case_matched] in the dead branches. Reasons why you may want to

  (** Create a single encoding from a series of cases.

     In JSON, all cases are tried one after the other using the [case list]. The
     caller is responsible for avoiding collisions. If there are collisions
     (i.e., if multiple cases produce the same JSON output) then the encoding
     and decoding processes might not be inverse of each other. In other words,
     [destruct e (construct e v)] may not be equal to [v].

     In binary, a prefix tag is added to discriminate quickly between
     cases. The default is [`Uint8] and you must use a [`Uint16] if
     you are going to have more than 256 cases.

     The matching function is used during binary encoding of a value
     [v] to efficiently determine which of the cases corresponds to
     [v]. The case list is used during decoding to reconstruct a value based on
     the encoded tag. (Decoding is optimised internally: tag look-up has a
     constant cost.)

     The caller is responsible for ensuring that the [matching_function] and the
     [case list] describe the same encoding. If they describe different
     encodings, then the decoding and encoding processes will not be inverses of
     each others. In other words, [of_bytes e (to_bytes e v)] will not be equal
     to [v].

     If you do not wish to be responsible for this, you can use the unoptimised
     {!union} that uses a [case list] only (see below). Beware that in {!union}
     the complexity of the encoding is linear in the number of cases.

     Following: a basic example use. Note that the [matching_function] uses the
     same tags, payload conversions, and payload encoding as the [case list].

  module Compact : sig
    (** This module provides specialized encoding combinators that are
        implemented to reduce the size of the serialization result.

        The main trick this module relies on is the notion of “shared tags”.
        In [Data_encoding], the [union] combinator uses (at least) one byte
        every time it is used, to “tag” the output and distinguish between
        various disjunction cases. As a consequence, if [n] [union] are
        composed together to define one encoding, (at least) [n] bytes are
        being allocated. However, in practice, only few bits are used in
        each tags, which means the rest is “wasted.”

        As an example, consider this type:

        {[
        type t =
          | T1 of { f1 : int option; f2 : (int, bool) Either.t }
          | T2 of { f3: int }
        ]}

        A value of [t] using the constructor [T1] will be serialized into
        a binary array of this form:

        {v
        ┌────────┬─────────┬─────────────┬─────────┬─────────────┐
        │ tag(t) │ tag(f1) │ payload(f1) │ tag(f2) │ payload(f2) │
        └────────┴─────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴─────────────┘
          1 byte   1 byte    N bytes       1 byte    M bytes
        v}

        Where [tag(f)] is a value used by [Data_encoding] to distinguish
        between several encoding alternatives for [f], and [payload(f)] is
        the resulting binary array.

        For both [option] and [Either.t], the tag of the encoding only uses
        one bit in practice. Which means that for [T1], encoding the pair
        [(f1, f2)] needs two bits, but the default approach of
        [Data_encoding] uses two {i bytes} instead.  Similarly, to
        distinguish between [T1] and [T2] needs one bit, but the default
        approach is to use an additional tag (one additional {i byte}).

        This module provides an approach to tackle this issue, by
        allocating only one tag ({i i.e.}, one byte) that is used to store
        the useful bits to distinguish between the disjunction cases. We
        call this tag the “shared tag” of the encoding. The bits of the
        shared tag describes precisely the layout of the encoded data.

        For instance, considering a compact encoding for [t], the third
        bit of the tag can be used to distinguish between [T1] and [T2].
        In case the third bit is 0, the first bit of the tag determines
        the case of [option], and the second the case of [Either.t].

        As a consequence the resulting binary array for the constructor
        [T1] is, using
        - [_] to represent meaningless bits,
        - [0] and [1] to represent actual bit values,
        - [e] to represent the bit used to distinguish the [Either] case of [f2], and
        - [o] to represent the bit used to distinguish the [Option] case of [f1]:

        {v
        ┌──────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
        │ _____0eo │ payload(f1) │ payload(f2) │
        └──────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
          1 byte     N bytes       M bytes
        v}

        while the resulting binary array for the constructor [T2] is

        {v
        ┌──────────┬─────────────┐
        │ _____100 │ payload(f3) │
        └──────────┴─────────────┘
          1 byte     N bytes
        v} *)

        The value uses some tag bits to distinguish the different cases of the

        (potentially 0) to distinguish the values within a case (see discussion
        of parameter [cases_tag_bits]).

        E.g., Given [type t = A of bool | B of int option] and the encoding
        {v
        let c =
          union [
            case "A" (function A b -> Some b | _ -> None) (fun b -> A b) bool;
            case "B" (function B i -> Some i | _ -> None) (fun i -> B b) (option (payload int));
        in
        make ~tag_size:`Uint8 c
        v}
        then a value can have either of the following 4 tags:
        - 0b00000000: case [A], [false]
        - 0b00000001: case [A], [true]
        - 0b00000010: case [B], [Some] (a payload of 4 bytes follows)
        - 0b00000011: case [B], [None]

        In other words, the second bit of this tag is used to discriminate the
        cases of the union, whilst the first bit is used to discriminate within
        each case.

        Note that the compact union can be combined with more compact encoding
        before being passed to [make] in which case the two bits of tags will be
        combined with the tags of the other compact encodings. E.g.,
        [make ~tag_size:`Uint8 (tup2 c c)].

        @param union_tag_bits is the number of bits used to distinguish the
        different cases of the union. For example, if the union has 4 cases
        (i.e., if [List.length cases = 4]) then you can use [~union_tag_bits:2].

        If not provided explicitly, [union_tag_bits] is inferred: it is set to
        the smallest value which can accommodate the provided [cases].

        It is recommended to set [union_tag_bits] explicitly.

        You can over-provision the [union_tag_bits] if you expect the
        [cases] to grow in the future.

        @raise Invalid_argument if the value passed for [union_tag_bits] is not
        sufficient to distinguish between the [cases].

        @param cases_tag_bits is the number of bits that each of the [cases] can
        use. This is only useful if the cases use more than 0 bits of tag.

        It is recommended to set [cases_tag_bits] explicitly if you need the
        layout to be stable even if the [cases] or one of its element changes.

        You can over-provision the [cases_tag_bits] if you expect one of the
        cases to change to use more bits of tag or if you expect that a new case
        using more tag bits will be added in the future.

        E.g., passing [~cases_tag_bits:7] to the [union] in the example above
        will cause the values to be represented as follows:
        - 0b00000000: case [A], [false]
        - 0b00000001: case [A], [true]
        - 0b10000000: case [B], [Some] (a payload of 4 bytes follows)
        - 0b10000001: case [B], [None]

        @raise Invalid_argument if one of the elements of [cases] needs more
        than [cases_tag_bits] bits of tag.

        E.g., [union ~cases_tag_bits:0 [case "Bool" Option.some Fun.id bool]]
        raises [Invalid_argument] because {!bool} uses one bit of tag which is

(** [json] is an encoding for JSON values. It is mostly intended for internal

    roundtrip. Specifically, [Json.destruct json (Json.construct json v)]
    is not guaranteed to be equal to [v]. More specifically, in BSON, top-level
    Arrays are represented as number-indexed Objects and this library has no way
    to distinguish between the two, doubly so for empty collections.

      encoding. You can only perform operations where the type doesn't

      and are subject to changes from one version of the library to another. *)

  (** A transparent, raw form of a {!register}ed encoding, allowing far greater
      introspection than a {!t} value. It can be retrieved using
      {!find_introspectable} or operated upon using {!iter}.

      Note that retrieval and iteration over [introspectable] preserve, but do not present, the
      type information of the original combinator. In other words,
      [introspectable] is a
      non-parametric abstraction over arbitrarily-typed [Encoding.t]. This means that,
      while it cannot be used in any way that would allow the underlying type parameter
      to escape, it can be operated upon (e.g. using {!iter}) using functions with
      locally abstract types ([fun (type a) -> ...]) or explicit polymorphism.


      The inclusion of this type is intended almost exclusively for use in
      specialized external tools rather than by casual users. As this type
      and its related functions permit introspection into a registered encoding
      that is otherwise opaque-by-design, it should only be relied
      upon as a last resort when no other options are available. *)

      discouraged from calling this function; it is designed only for
      external tools to process raw encodings that cannot be brought
      into scope except through querying the [Registration] module.

      be used only once, as an argument to a function call, and discarded
      subsequently.
