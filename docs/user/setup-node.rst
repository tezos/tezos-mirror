Setting up the node
===================

A node in the Tezos network provides different configuration possibilities:

- tune various parameters of the node using flexible combinations of: a configuration file, command-line options, and environment variables
- specify the Tezos network to connect to, which can be the Mainnet or different test networks.
- configure the amount of history kept by the node according to different tradeoffs, using history modes
- rapidly catch up with a given (main or test) network by loading network snapshots
- set up infrastructure for continuosly monitoring the node to help spotting operational or efficiency issues
- set up infrastructure for continuosly monitoring the chain consensus spotting operational or efficiency issues

These possibilities are described in the following pages.
