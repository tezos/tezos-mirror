Supported Open Metrics
======================

The smart-rollup node is able to produce metrics information and serve them in the
`Open Metrics
<https://openmetrics.io/>`_ format, an emerging standard for exposing metrics data, especially used in cloud-based systems.

The smart-rollup node supports the following metrics, characterized by: the name of
the metric, the type of the metric as in the `open metrics specification
<https://openmetrics.io/>`__, a user-friendly description of the metric and a
list of labels (that can be used to aggregate or query metrics).

For more information check the Open Metrics specification.
