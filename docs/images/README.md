# Image resources

This directory contains images to be used in the following situations:
- images to be used across several pages from different directories
- images for the page(s) int the root directory (e.g. `index.rst`)

Images that are used only within (the pages in) one directory should rather be placed in that directory.

## Images for the homepage

The doc homepage (`index.rst`) contains a series of banner images used as guided paths for various categories of users. These images respect a common pattern, compatible with the NL graphic chart, and varying (nuances of) colours in some particular order. They should only be updated together, to keep them uniform and coherent.



### Updating the banner images

The banner images are made with Figma and can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/o948kXk3DkGgsObfRNyN5L).
The file can be copied and then edited. It's one page with 6 frames, where each frame can be downloaded separately as a .png file,
corresponding to the 6 menu items. The icons set used in the banners can be found
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/j14pYxTfenMHbxK7UNdJky/Koloicons-%7C-3000%2B-Icons-%7C-Detailed-Pack-%28Community%29?node-id=4%3A4934).

Currently the images are sized at 1000 x 68 and use the following colors:

\#01B3F3 \
\#019CF2 \
\#006EF0 \
\#0055C8 \
\#003CA0 \
\#000040
