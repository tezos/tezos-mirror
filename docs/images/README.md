# Image resources

This directory contains images to be used in the following situations:
- images to be used across several pages from different directories
- images for the page(s) int the root directory (e.g. `index.rst`)

Images that are used only within (the pages in) one directory should rather be placed in that directory.

## Images for the homepage

None by now.
