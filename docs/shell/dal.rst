Data Availability Layer
=======================

The Data-Availability Layer (or DAL) is a software component of Octez which allows users to publish data outside of the Tezos Layer 1 blocks, with no compromises on decentralization principles.
Its primary use case today is to scale the data bandwidth of :doc:`smart rollups <../active/smart_rollups>`, but other applications could be envisioned in the future.

The following pages provide an overview of the DAL and cover its different aspects and features.
