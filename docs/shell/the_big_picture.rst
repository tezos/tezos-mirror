Octez Software Architecture
===========================

This page presents the software architecture of the Octez suite, focusing on the most important tool in a Tezos network: the Tezos node, implemented in our case as the Octez node executable (``octez-node``).
The Octez node software architecture faithfully implements the `Tezos software architecture <https://docs.tezos.com/architecture>`__ principles:

- It is separated into a shell and a protocol, to support protocol evolution.
- It implements a client/server architecture, to allow composition with many other tools in a safe way.

This page contains two sections. The first section, which should be
readable by anyone, describes the main elements of a Tezos node from a
distance. It abstracts from all plumbing and both internal and system
dependencies to give a simple view of the main components, their
responsibilities, and interactions. The second part is written for
developers and is at the level of OPAM packages.

Although the description is focused on the Octez node, some of these components are reused to generate other tools in the Octez suite, see :ref:`final_executables`.

.. _the_big_picture:

The Big Picture
---------------
The diagram below shows a very coarse-grained architecture of the Tezos node.

|Tezos architecture diagram|

The characteristic that makes Tezos unique is its self-amending
property. The part that amends itself is called :doc:`the economic protocol<../alpha/protocol>`
(the green brain of the octopus), sometimes abbreviated by protocol or
even proto in the source code. The rest of a Tezos node is what we call
the *shell* (the blue octopus).

The protocol is responsible for interpreting the transactions and other
administrative operations. It also has the responsibility to detect
erroneous blocks.

An important thing to notice is that the protocol always sees only one
block chain, that is a linear sequence of blocks since the
genesis. It does not know that it lives in an open network where nodes
can propose alternative heads.

Only the shell knows about the multiple heads. It is responsible for
choosing between the various chain proposals that come from the bakers
(the programs that cook new blocks) of the network. The shell has the
responsibility of selecting and downloading alternative chains, feed
them to the protocol, which in turn has the responsibility to check
them for errors, and give them an absolute score. The shell then
simply selects the valid head of the highest absolute score. This part
of the shell is called :doc:`the validator <../shell/validation>`.

The rest of the shell includes the peer-to-peer layer, the disk storage
of blocks, the operations to allow the node to transmit the chain data
to new nodes and the versioned state of the ledger. In-between the
validator, the peer-to-peer layer, and the storage sits a component
called the distributed database, that abstracts the fetching and
replication of new chain data to the validator.

Protocols are compiled using a tweaked OCaml compiler (green part on the
left of the picture) that does two things. First, it checks that the
protocol’s main module has the right type. A good analogy is to see
protocol as plug-ins, and in this case, it means that it respects the
common plugin interface. Then, it restricts the typing environment of
the protocol’s code so that it only calls authorized modules and
functions. Seeing protocols as plug-ins, it means that the code only
called primitives from the plug-in API. It is a form of statically
enforced sandboxing (see :doc:`./protocol_environment`).

Note that the economic protocol on the chain is subject to an amendment
procedure. On-chain operations can be used to switch from one protocol to
another. The procedure is described in more details in :doc:`the protocol's
voting procedure documentation<../active/voting>`.

Finally, the RPC layer (in yellow on the right in the picture) is an
important part of the node. It is how the client, third-party
applications and daemons can interact with the node and introspect its
state. This component uses the mainstream JSON format and HTTP
protocol.  It uses the library ``resto``. It is fully
interoperable, and auto descriptive, using JSON schema.

.. _packages:

Software Architecture and Packages Relationship
------------------------------------------------
The diagram below shows the main OPAM packages present in the source
code of Tezos, and their dependencies. The ``tezos-`` or ``octez-`` prefixes have been
dropped for clarity.

|Tezos source packages diagram|

In green at the bottom are binaries. Highlighted in yellow are the OPAM
packages (sometimes with shortened names). Black arrows show direct
dependencies. Orange arrows show other indirect relationships (code
generation, interface sharing), explained below. The part circled in
blue, contains modules that bear no dependency to Unix, and can thus
be compiled to JavaScript. External dependencies are not shown in this
illustration.

Note that many packages described below are grouped in a single one: :package:`octez-libs`.
This includes packages as diverse as :package-api:`tezos-stdlib <octez-libs/Tezos_stdlib/index.html>`, :package-api:`tezos-base <octez-libs/Tezos_base/index.html>`, :package-api:`tezos-shell-services <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_shell_services/index.html>`, :package-api:`tezos-context <octez-libs/Tezos_context/index.html>`, etc.)

Base and below
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the center, the :package-api:`tezos-base <octez-libs/Tezos_base/index.html>` package is where
the blockchain specific code starts. Above it in the figure (but below
in terms of abstraction level) is the set of libraries
that are used everywhere for basic operations.

- :package-api:`tezos-stdlib <octez-libs/Tezos_stdlib/index.html>` contains a few extensions over the
  OCaml standard library (a few string primitives, an ``Option``
  module, etc.), a few ``Lwt`` utilities, and a ``Compare`` module
  that implements monomorphic comparison operators.
- :package-api:`tezos-error-monad <octez-libs/Tezos_error_monad/index.html>` is an in-house monadic
  interface to the OCaml ``('a, 'b) result`` type, that fixes the
  ``'b`` to an extensible type ``error`` (actually a list, to hold an
  error trace). When extending the type, programmers must also call
  the ``register_error`` function that registers a pretty printer and
  an encoding for serialization.
  A :doc:`tutorial<../developer/error_monad>` is available for this library.
- :package-api:`tezos-rpc <octez-libs/Tezos_rpc/index.html>` provides the basics of Tezos' RPC service
  mechanism. It provides combinators for building service hierarchies
  à la Ocsigen/Eliom, registering, and calling services. This module
  is based on :opam:`resto`, that allows for automatic
  generation of machine and human-readable descriptions of the hierarchy of
  services, including: the structure of URLs and the expected formats for input
  and output bodies, via the use of ``data_encoding``.
- :package-api:`tezos-crypto <octez-libs/Tezos_crypto/index.html>` wraps the external cryptography
  libraries that we use. We try to use minimal reference
  implementations, with as thin as possible bindings, and
  rely on libraries from the
  `HACL* project <https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star>`_,
  written and verified in the F* programming language, and extracted
  to C.
- :package-api:`tezos-micheline <octez-libs/Tezos_micheline/index.html>` is the concrete syntax used by
  Michelson, the language of smart contracts. It mostly contains the
  generic, untyped AST, a printer, and a parser.
- :package-api:`tezos-base <octez-libs/Tezos_base/index.html>` wraps all these modules in a common foundation
  for all the other components of Tezos, and introduces the data
  structures of the blockchain (e.g. ``Block_hash``,
  ``Block_header``, ``Block_locator``, ``Fitness``, ``P2p_identity``)
  that are shared between the shell, economic protocol, client,
  daemons and third-party software. It also rewraps some modules from
  ``crypto`` as functors that build all-in-one modules for a given
  type (for instance, the module for block hashes contains all
  possible converters, command line and RPC argument builders, pretty
  printers, an autocompleter, etc.). This package also contains the
  ``cli_entries`` module that we use to handle command-line parsing
  in some executables.

The Shell
~~~~~~~~~

The shell is the part of the node responsible for all communications,
peer-to-peer and RPC, acting as a cocoon around the economic
protocols.

- :package-api:`tezos-shell-services <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_shell_services/index.html>` contains the definition of the
  node's service hierarchy, and calling functions to use in the
  client (or any third party software). As this library is linked
  into the client to call the services in a type-safe way, only the
  description of services is done here. The registration of handlers
  is done in the rest of the node's implementation.
- :package-api:`tezos-rpc-http-client <octez-libs/Tezos_rpc_http_client/index.html>` and :package-api:`tezos-rpc-http-server <octez-libs/Tezos_rpc_http_server/index.html>`
  use :opam:`cohttp` to implement the RPC
  over HTTP server and client, allowing to make actual use of
  services declared using :package-api:`tezos-rpc <octez-libs/Tezos_rpc/index.html>`.
- :package-api:`tezos-p2p <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_p2p/index.html>` is the in-house peer-to-peer layer.
- :package-api:`tezos-store <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_store/index.html>` is the chain-data store that handles
  on-disk block storage, snapshots exporting/importing and chain
  reconstruction.
- :package-api:`tezos-context <octez-libs/Tezos_context/index.html>` contains the raw versioned key-value store
  used for storing the ledger's context (one version per
  block). This is implemented using :opam:`irmin`.
- :package-api:`tezos-protocol-updater <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_protocol_updater/index.html>` maintains the table of available
  protocol versions, embedded or dynamically linked.
- :package-api:`tezos-shell <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_shell/index.html>` implements the scheduling of block
  validations, the mempool management, and the distributed database.
  A description is available in :doc:`this document <../shell/validation>`.

The Economic Protocol Environment and Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Economic protocols are compiled by a specific version of the OCaml
compiler. This compiler restricts the set of modules available to the
economic protocol, as a form of static sandboxing. It also generates a
functorized version of the protocol, to make the execution of the
protocol in an alternative environment possible.

- :package-api:`tezos-protocol-environment <octez-proto-libs/Tezos_protocol_environment/index.html>` contains the protocol
  generic environment, that is the API of the modules that are available to
  the economic protocol and the exported protocol API. A review of this
  sandbox is available :doc:`here <../shell/protocol_environment>`.
  These modules include a stripped-down standard library, and interfaces
  to the crypto APIs, RPC definitions, and a key-value store.
  It also defines two different context instances: one that simulates
  the key-value store in memory for testing, and one whose context function
  are dummy ones which can be used when only the types and noncontextual
  functions of the protocol are needed.

- :package:`octez-protocol-compiler` is the compiler for economic
  protocols: an alternative driver to the OCaml
  :opam:`ocaml-compiler-libs` that typechecks within the protocol
  environment, and performs some more checks on the protocol code.

- ``tezos-protocol-xxx`` is produced by the protocol compiler
  and contains a functorized version of protocol ``xxx`` that takes its
  standard library as a parameter. This parameter can be filled with
  any of the implementations described in the two points below.

- :package-api:`tezos-shell-context <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_shell_context/index.html>` implements a context representation
  that is accepted by the protocol environment. The node uses this
  instance to read and write data on disk.

- ``tezos-embedded-protocol-xxx`` contains a version of the protocol
  ``xxx`` whose standard library is pre-instantiated to the shell's
  implementation, these are the ones that are linked into the
  node. It also contains a module that registers the protocol in the
  node's protocol table.

.. _embedded_protocols:

The Embedded Economic Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three kinds of economic protocols are included in the main Octez repository.

- The genesis protocol. :package:`tezos-protocol-genesis`
  (:package-api:`tezos-embedded-protocol-genesis <tezos-protocol-genesis/Tezos_embedded_protocol_genesis/index.html>`) is the protocol of
  the genesis block. It accepts a single block, signed by an
  activator whose public key is hardcoded, and whose single action is to
  switch to a new protocol chosen by the activator.
  The ``master`` branch contains additional variants of the genesis
  protocol, one for each of the existing :ref:`test
  networks<test_networks>`.
- The active protocols. ``tezos-protocol-nnn-hhhhhhhh``
  (``tezos-embedded-protocol-nnn-hhhhhhhh``) is either the current
  protocol on Mainnet or a protocol that has been active on Mainnet
  at some point, where ``nnn`` is a counter starting at 0 and
  ``hhhhhhhh`` is a prefix of the hash of the protocol code.
  Also, :package:`tezos-protocol-alpha`
  (:package-api:`tezos-embedded-protocol-alpha <tezos-protocol-alpha/Tezos_embedded_protocol_alpha/index.html>`) on the ``master``
  branch is the protocol currently under development
  (see :ref:`here<node-protocol>` for more details).
  A :doc:`tutorial<../developer/entering_alpha>` is available to start reading
  the protocol's code.
- Demo protocols. :package-api:`tezos-embedded-protocol-demo-noops <tezos-protocol-demo-noops/Tezos_embedded_protocol_demo_noops/index.html>` is just a demo
  protocol that does nothing interesting but has the right
  shape. :package-api:`tezos-embedded-protocol-demo-counter <tezos-protocol-demo-counter/Tezos_embedded_protocol_demo_counter/index.html>` is another demo
  protocol in which blocks can contain simple operations.


The Client Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client is split into many packages, to enforce three separation
lines: shell vs economic protocol, Unix dependent vs JavaScript
compatible, and library vs command-line interface.

- :package-api:`tezos-client-base <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_client_base/index.html>` defines the client context, which is
  an object whose methods allow for: accessing a wallet of keys,
  interacting via the user, making RPC calls, and signing data using
  signer plug-ins. Most of them, including RPC calling functions from
  :package-api:`tezos-shell-services <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_shell_services/index.html>` and
  :package:`tezos-protocol-alpha`, are abstracted over this object
  type. That way, it is possible to use the same code for different
  platforms or toolkits.
- :package-api:`tezos-client-alpha <octez-protocol-alpha-libs/Tezos_client_alpha/index.html>` provides some functions to perform
  the operations of protocol Alpha using the wallet and signers from
  the client context.
- :package:`tezos-client-genesis` contains the basic activator
  commands available on the genesis protocol.
- :package-api:`tezos-client-base-unix <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_client_base_unix/index.html>` implements configuration file
  and wallet storage in Unix files, user interaction via the Unix
  console, and terminal based signer plug-ins.

Tests Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tests are split into various packages, testing more and more
elements while following the dependency chain. Use ``make test`` to
run them.

- :src:`tezt/`:
  end-to-end tests as Tezt tests that e.g. launch local sandboxed nodes
  and performs various tasks using the client
- :package-api:`tezos-p2p <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_p2p/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_p2p/test/`):
  tests of the peer-to-peer layer, independently of the Tezos gossip
  protocol (establishing connections, propagating peers, etc.)
- :package-api:`tezos-protocol-environment <octez-proto-libs/Tezos_protocol_environment/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_protocol_environment/test/`):
  tests for the in-memory context implementation.
- :package-api:`tezos-shell <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_shell/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_shell/test/`):
  tests for the chain data storage.
- :package-api:`tezos-stdlib <octez-libs/Tezos_stdlib/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_stdlib/test/`):
  tests for the basic data structures.
- :package-api:`tezos-context <octez-libs/Tezos_context/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_context/test/`):
  tests for the versioned key-value context.
- :package-api:`tezos-store <octez-shell-libs/Tezos_store/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_store/unix/test/`):
  tests for the on-disk store.
- :package:`tezos-protocol-alpha`
  (in directory :src:`src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/test/`):
  tests of the Alpha protocol (without launching a node).
- :package-api:`tezos-crypto <octez-libs/Tezos_crypto/index.html>`
  (in directory :src:`src/lib_crypto/test/`):
  tests for the in-house merkle trees.

.. _final_executables:

The Final Executables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Octez executables are generated from packages such as the following ones (for the complete list of binaries, see :ref:`tezos_binaries`):

- :package:`octez-node` provides the node launcher binary
  ``octez-node``. All the algorithmic being implemented in the
  shell, this package only implements the node's CLI. It also
  provides the sandboxed node shell script launcher (see the main
  readme).
- :package:`octez-client` provides the ``octez-client`` and
  ``octez-admin-client`` binaries. The former contains a small
  command line wallet, the latter an administration tool for the
  node. It also provides a shell script that configures a shell
  environment to interact with a sandboxed node.
- :package:`octez-baker-alpha` provides the ``octez-baker-alpha``
  binary.
- :package:`octez-accuser-alpha` provides the ``octez-accuser-alpha``
  binary.
- :package:`octez-protocol-compiler` provides the
  ``octez-protocol-compiler`` binary that is used by the node to
  compile new protocols on the fly, and that can be used for
  developing new protocols.
