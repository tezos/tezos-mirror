Protocol Alpha
==============

This page lists the changes brought by protocol Alpha with respect
to Seoul (see :ref:`naming_convention`).
For the list of changes brought by Seoul with respect to Rio, see :doc:`../protocols/023_seoul`.

For a higher-level overview of the most salient new features see the
`announcement blog <https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/blog.html>`__.

The code can be found in directory :src:`src/proto_alpha` of the ``master``
branch of Octez and the full documentation in :doc:`this page <../alpha/index>`.

Operation receipts
------------------

- Added ``address_registry_diff`` field that represents the addresses indexed with
  the opcode ``INDEX_ADDRESS`` in the operation. (MR :gl:`!18870`)

Protocol parameters
-------------------

- Lowered the number of blocks per cycle (``blocks_per_cycle``) from
  10800 (~1 day) to 1800 (~4 hours) on mainnet (with 8-second minimal
  block time). (MR :gl:`!17583`)

  - On ghostnet where minimal block time is 4s, lowered
    ``blocks_per_cycle`` from 10800 (~12 hours) to 3600 (~4
    hours). (MR :gl:`!17583`)

- In order for the duration of voting periods to stay about the same,
  updated the number of cycles per voting period
  (``cycles_per_voting_period``) on mainnet from 14 cycles (that is,
  ~14 days with old cycle duration) to 84 cycles (~14 days with new
  cycle duration). (MR :gl:`!17583`)

- In order to keep the same duration in days for the activation of
  delegate parameters, updated the number of cycles after which
  submitted delegate parameters take effect
  (``delegate_parameters_activation_delay``) on mainnet from 5 cycles
  (that is, ~5 days with old cycle duration) to 30 cycles (~5 days
  with new cycle duration). (MR :gl:`!17583`)

- Reduced blocks per commitment (``blocks_per_commitment``) to 14 to
  keep the number of nonces per cycle to 128. (:gl:`!17583`)

- Reduced the nonce revelation period (``nonce_revelation_threshold``)
  from 300 blocks to 150 blocks. Reduced accordingly the VDF
  difficulty (``vdf_difficulty``) as well. (:gl:`!17583`)

- Lowered the ``consensus_rights_delay`` protocol constant from 2
  cycles to 1 cycle. (MR :gl:`!18783`)

- Reduced the ``cache_stake_distribution_cycles`` and
  ``cache_sampler_state_cycles`` protocol constants from 5 cycles to 4
  cycles, in order to reduce memory consumption. Only
  ``consensus_rights_delay + slashing_delay + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4``
  cycles are needed. (MR :gl:`!18783`)
