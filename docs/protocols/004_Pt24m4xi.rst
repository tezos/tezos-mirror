Protocol Athens
===============

This page contains all the relevant information for protocol 004 Athens
(004_Pt24m4xi).

The main changes in this protocol are:

- reduction of roll size to ꜩ8k from the ꜩ10k that were required in
  protocol 003
- different gas accounting, leading to changes in minimal fee for
  operations
- increase of gas limits per operation and per block
- forbid the origination of new spendable smart-contracts
- disable the re-activation of a delegate by crediting its account,
  the only way to re-activate a delegate is to register again as
  delegate
- minor changes to RPCs

The breaking changes are listed in more details in the changelog.

Gas and fees
------------

In protocol 003 the cost of IOs was slightly underestimated, and thus
the balance between IOs and computation has been adjusted in this
update.
As a result, the number of IOs performed in a block stays unchanged,
while the number of computation steps is doubled.

The formula to compute the required fees per operation has not
changed::

  fees >= minimal_fees +
          minimal_nanotez_per_byte * size +
          minimal_nanotez_per_gas_unit * gas

however, as a consequence of the increased gas accounting, the
required fees have changed.

(*) if the recipient is a new address

It should be noted that a transfer has a slightly higher cost for larger
amounts.
The reason is that the amount is encoded using a binary representation
with dynamic size and thus in the above formula ``size`` is slightly
larger.

In all cases, it is recommended to simulate an operation before
injecting it on the chain.
Using ``tezos-client``, it is possible to run only a simulation using
the ``--dry-run`` option.


Changelog
---------

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Alpha/Delegation: set the tokens_per_roll constant to 8000 tez (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@5e2b9790`)

    This patch sets the new default roll size to 8000 tez.

- Alpha/Delegation: do not activate delegate when crediting (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@a96b03dd`)

    Remove the unneeded method for a delegate to reactivate itself by
    provisioning its account. The delegate should simply re-register as
    delegate.

- Alpha/Michelson: double gas limit, except for I/Os that stay unchanged (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@3a39d70a`)

    This change doubles the maximum amount of gas for the block and for
    each transaction. The cost of I/Os is updated accordingly, so that the
    number of computation steps is increased, while the number of possible
    I/Os in a block stays unchanged.

- Alpha/Michelson: do not allow spendable smart contracts (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@01b5bb08`)

    This patches forbids the creation of spendable smart contracts, a
    current feature that is not necessary (it can be implemented from the
    contract's code) and prevents some possible future optimisations.

    It also prevents the creation of non spendable non scripted contracts,
    which was mostly a design flaw that could let people inadvertently lock funds.

    This is done by checking the flag in the origination operation rather
    than removing it so the change is lighter for third party software.

- Alpha/RPCs: fix wrong encoding name fields (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@5b410693`)

    This patch fixes a mislabeled field in the JSON encoding of operation receipts.
    The balance updates had a field ``level`` that actually contained a cycle.
    It is now named ``cycle``.

    Third party software that make use of receipts such as block explorers
    or wallets may need to be updated accordingly. A simple solution is to
    support both during the protocol change period.

- Alpha/RPCs: change ``managerPubkey`` to underscores in json field names (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@50cf26f0`)

    This renames a field in the JSON format of origination operations to
    make it consistent with the others.

    Third party software must be updated to support this change.
    For applications that just consume this format, it is enough to just recognise
    both field names during the protocol change period. For applications that send
    this format to the node, it is necessary to send the right one depending on the
    ``next_protocol`` field of the interrogated block.

- Alpha/RPCs: rename field labels in Michelson typechecker output (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@7b4fe1b9`)

    This is a change in field names in the Michelson typechecking RPC output.
    A simple solution for third party tools to handle the change is to
    recognise both field names during the protocol update period.

- Alpha/RPCs: rename Michelson interpreter diagnostics field names (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@94cfcfd2`)

    This patch changes some error IDs and error attributes to make it
    consistent with the rest of the codebase.

    Third party development tools that recognise errors based on this
    should be updated. As errors are only read, a simple solution is to
    support both during the protocol change period.


Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Alpha/RPCs: optional fields for source, payer, gas in run and trace (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@2d51e996`)

    This patch adds new options to the Michelson interpreter RPCs.
    They allow customization of interpreter behaviour.
    It only makes utility RPCs more flexible, and does not change the
    semantics of Michelson.

- Alpha/Vote: fix initialization of voting rights from genesis (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@91fa2d7f`)

    This patch fixes the voting system initialisation from genesis.

    It improves voting in sandbox mode and test networks.
    It has no effect on mainnet.

- Alpha/Vote: docstrings and one renaming (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@09794e40`)

    This patch adds documentation to the code.
    It does not change the semantics.

- Alpha/Vote: fix potential overflow in quorum computation (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@d98fe4e5`)

    This patch prevents a potential overflow if the number of rolls gets
    too big in a future update. This bug cannot happen with the current
    value.

- Alpha/Vote: new constant ``test_chain_duration`` (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@34aaf6c7`)

    This patch turns the test chain lifetime from a hardcoded two-days
    constant in the code to a parameter. This is useful for testing of
    the voting system, for testnet rehearsals, or for more easily changing
    the value in a future protocol upgrade.

    The value of this constant is also updated to prolong the test chain
    to the end of period. The test chain is now spawned at the beginning of
    the third voting period and lasts the whole period.

- Alpha/Michelson: allows big maps in genesis blocks (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@f6d67b7a`)

    This patch allows to create a sandbox chain with bootstrap contracts
    that use big_maps. This change is mostly useful for testing in
    sandbox mode or custom deployments.

    This has no effect on mainnet.

- Alpha/Delegation: allow to change the roll value (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@079eda15`)

    This patch adds a function to reassign rolls given a new roll size.

- Alpha/Contracts: uniform indexation for both implicit and originated contracts (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@82fc0334`)

    This patch change the way contracts are indexed internally, using the
    same database paths for implicit contracts, delegate accounts,
    scripted and non scripted contracts.

    It simplifies future updates, for instance to add new account types.

- Alpha/Refactor: remove unused compare module in constants (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@dcec0442`)

    This commit removes a small piece of unused code.

- Alpha/Refactor: use return_* (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@e8213708`)

    Replaces some allocations of common return values by preallocated constants.
    This is a cosmetic change that does not alter the semantics.

- Alpha/Refactor: simplify code of ``Raw_context.prepare_first_block`` (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@a3d04dd2`)

    This patch simplifies the protocol migration code.
    It does not change the semantics.


Migration
~~~~~~~~~

- Alpha/Michelson/Migration: double hard_gas_limit_per_{operation,block} (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@d65c58c2`)

    This patch is part of the migration code from ``alpha_003`` to ``athens_004``.

    It performs the migration of the constants in mainnet to update them
    to the new (doubled) default values.

- Alpha/Delegation/Migration: reassign rolls (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@b9408be7`)

    This patch is part of the migration code from ``alpha_003`` to ``athens_004``.

    It performs the roll size update to 8000 tez.

- Alpha/Migration: invoicing example (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@e010d700`)

    This patch is part of the migration code from ``alpha_003`` to ``athens_004``.

    It credits the account of the authors of this protocol with a symbolic
    value of a hundred tez.

    The authors hereby declare that these tez will be used exclusively
    to pay for a round of drinks for the Nomadic team.

- Alpha/Vote/Migration: update constants binary representation (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@d0c16b4f`)

    This patch is part of the migration code from ``alpha_003`` to ``athens_004``.

    Since we changed ``Constants_repr.parametric_encoding`` for adding the
    new constant ``test_chain_duration``, we need to upgrade the content
    of the ``constants_key`` in the context.

- Alpha/Contracts/Migration: reindex contracts (:gl:`nomadic-labs/tezos@8618b475`)

    This patch is part of the migration code from ``alpha_003`` to ``athens_004``.

    It performs the migration of contracts to the new uniform storage format.
