Protocol Delphi
===============

This page contains all the relevant information for protocol 007 Delphi (007_PsDELPH1).
Each of the main changes is briefly described with links to relevant
external documentation and commits.
The changelog section contains the most significant commit messages
and instructions to regenerate the protocol sources from the
Gitlab branch.

Test network Delphinet is available to test Delphi.
See details in :ref:`Test Networks<test_networks>`
and instructions to join in :ref:`How to get Tezos<howtoget>`.

The source code of this proposal is available in `this tar archive
<https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/files/delphi_007_PsDELPH1.tar>`_ and its
full hash is ``PsDELPH1Kxsxt8f9eWbxQeRxkjfbxoqM52jvs5Y5fBxWWh4ifpo``.

**This protocol contains several breaking changes with respect to Carthage.**
Developers are particularly encouraged to carefully read this page and
to monitor it for updates.

Performance Improvements
------------------------

Some effort was directed to streamline the Michelson interpreter and
improve its performance. This mostly consisted in factoring gas
consumption, simplifying logging and removing some calls to ``Lwt``
(cf. the dedicated section on that last point).

Patches:

-  217b4fd025 Proto/Michelson: abstract logging facility
-  7504b35b94 Proto/Michelson: make lists carry their size and type of
   elements
-  c744b2e36e Proto/Michelson: hoist gas consumption in
   Slice_{string,bytes}
-  9854ddc12a Proto/Michelson: hoist Gas.consume out of interp. pattern
   matching

Gas Changes
-----------

Gas accounting has seen a significant update. Even though gas limits are
the same as in Carthage, the amount of computation per unit of gas
should see a significant increase in Delphi.

More precisely, the following parts of the gas subsystem have been
updated. - Following the optimization work on the interpreter, gas costs
for all instructions have been recomputed. - The cost model for IOs has
been updated and should account better for performances of modern
storage hardware. - The typechecking system has an entirely new cost
model. - Finally, the base gas cost of manager operations has been
reduced from 10000 to 1000 units of gas.

Overall, users should see significant gas cost reductions accross the
board.

Change in format of receipts related to gas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The protocol now internally handles *milligas* but exposes gas to the
user. - Protocol constants such as per-block and per-operation gas
limits are **still specified in gas**. - On the input side of the
protocol, the ``gas_limit`` field in manager operations is **still
specified in gas**, as before. - On the output side, receipts contain
both the ``consumed_gas`` (as before) and a new field
``consumed_milligas``. The relationship between this two fields is the
following:

.. math::


   consumed\_gas = \lceil consumed\_milligas / 1000 \rceil

In other terms, ``consumed_gas``, provided for backwards compatibility,
is the rounded-up version of ``consumed_milligas``. Users wanting to
have the most accurate description of the gas consumption of their
transfers should consider using ``consumed_milligas``.

To make understanding the change easier, here is a small example
illustrating a transfer in sandboxed mode to a toy ``minimal.tz``
contract:

::

   { parameter int ;
     storage unit ;
     code { CDR ; NIL operation; PAIR } }

Let us originate this contract.

::

   tezos-client -l originate contract mini transferring 0 from bootstrap1 running minimal.tz --burn-cap 0.07375 --init 'Unit'

During simulation, the ``preapply`` RPC is given the following
operation:

::

   { "protocol": "ProtoALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaDdp3zK",
     "branch": "BMSAKmQD2Q2Ghk2jtHMGpx5Zww98oLsFdh4XW1863TizUjyfY8S",
     "contents":
     [ { "kind": "origination",
         "source": ..., "fee": "434", "counter": "1",
         "gas_limit": "1690",
         "storage_limit": "315",
         "balance": "0",
         "script": ... }

The ``gas_limit``, equal to ``1690`` in this example, is labelled in
**gas**. The outcome of the simulation is the following receipt:

::

   { "kind": "origination",
               "source": ..., "fee": "434",
               "counter": "1",
               "gas_limit": "1690",
               "storage_limit": "315", "balance": "0",
               "script": ...,
               "metadata":
                 { "balance_updates": ...,
                   "operation_result":
                     { "status": "applied", "big_map_diff": [],
                       "balance_updates": ...,
                       "originated_contracts": ...,
                       "consumed_gas": "1590",
                       "consumed_milligas": "1589562",
                       "storage_size": "38",
                       "paid_storage_size_diff": "38" } } }

The metadata contains both: - the field ``consumed_milligas``,
corresponding to the **exact** amount of gas consumed, labelled in
**milligas**; - the field ``consumed_gas``, obtained by ceiling the
milligas value as described above, labelled in **gas**.

Note that the ``tezos-client`` binary prints gas, not milligas. However
it displays three decimals:

Lowered storage costs
---------------------

In Tezos, storing data in the state leads to a burn of tez proportional
to the size of the storage increase. This happens when creating a new
account, originationg a new smart contract or making the storage of a
smart contract grow above its historical higher size. This is different
from fees that are paid to the baker proportionally to the size of
operations. Indeed, operations are transient (and can be forgotten by
nodes in the lighweight rolling mode), while data in the state is
replicated by all nodes and can be so forever.

In Delphi, the amount of tez burned to store data in the ledger’s state
is decreased by a factor of 4, going from 1 tez to 0.25 tez for a
kilobyte. The price to create a new account is thus lowered from 0.257
tez to 0.06425.

Patches:

-  8f808e8317 proto/parameters: reduce cost_per_byte to 0.000250tz
-  ffaba729db proto/migration: set cost_per_byte to 0.000250tz

Bug fixes
---------

Compatibility with 32-bit platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carthage has some parts that assume a 64-bit runtime. These
modifications restore the compatibility with 32-bit systems, and in
general make the code clearer and less dependent on the underlying word
size.

Patches:

-  da91297c0d Protocol/Michelson: avoid overflowing [Int32.to_int
   Int32.max_int]
-  377af3acb0 Proto/Michelson: Simplify parse_uint30
-  06c2f6f97b Protocol: Safer Int64.to_int
-  40f9a2c9a3 Storage: rename Int -> UInt16
-  ceb4ef33ba Storage: rename Int_index -> Int31_index
-  70c0aa4641 Proto/Gas: Zarith-ify some cost functions

BREAKING CHANGE: Michelson annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Field annotations in Michelson types were not properly checked and could
contain invalid characters. In particular, it was possible to use a
digit as the first meaningful character of a field annotation but only
if it appeared in a type; a few contracts on Mainnet contain such
numerals as first meaningful character. We have added the missing check
and extended the syntax of Michelson annotations to allow digits. At the
time of writing, all Mainnet and Carthagenet contracts successfully
typecheck.

BREAKING CHANGE: If a smart contract containing a non-numeral invalid
character in a field annotation inside a type were to be originated
before the activation of Delphi, such a contract would be locked by the
activation.

Patches:

-  ec1d992e5c Use plain algebraic types for the Michelson annotations
-  642bab2f97 Proto/Michelson: ensures all annotations are checked
-  0f12f628e9 Proto/Michelson: extend the set of allowed Michelson
   annotations

General code cleanup and refactoring
------------------------------------

Removal of ``Lwt`` when possible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A large batch of changes consists in mostly trivial modifications that
drop parts of the code that don’t perform IOs out of the IO monad. This
makes the code a bit less uniform, but helps with safety and future
refactoring, and in some cases increases performance (in particular in
the interpreter).

Safety of Michelson
-------------------

Explicit limitations in the Michelson typechecker and interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Up until now, some features of Michelson were implicitly limited by gas.
This series of changes add explicit limits that will help with safety,
future refactoring, and debugging (more precise errors).

-  Deep stack instructions ``DIG``, ``DUG``, ``DROP``, and ``DIP`` are
   now bounded to stacks of less than 1024 elements
-  The interpreter (resp. typechecker) now have explicit recursion
   limits, setting a maximum depths for terms that can be interpreted
   (resp. typechecked).

Both changes set limits to high enough values, and should thus be
invisible to almost all contract authors. Reaching the limits is only
likely to happen when debugging erroneous (such as non-terminating)
code.

Patches:

-  4c019e1004 Proto/Michelson: fix error message for DIP with wrong
   constant
-  7d0211b648 Michelson: fix number_of_generated_growing_types
-  6a7bbf17a4 Proto: add max stack depth
-  040abed403 Proto: normalize stackoverflows in typechecking and
   unparsing
-  95c31f963c Michelson: restrict deep stack instructions to 1023
