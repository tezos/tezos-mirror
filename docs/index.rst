Welcome to the Octez and Protocol Documentation!

**Never heard of Octez?** Let's get acquainted!

Octez & the Tezos protocol are an implementation of the `Tezos blockchain <https://tezos.com>`__ , a
distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability.

This means that, unlike other blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Tezos comes to consensus not only about the state of its ledger, but also about how the protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

This is a fundamental design choice, allowing Tezos to be seamlessly upgradable and continuously evolving.
Due to this feature, Tezos is built to last, and always stay at the leading edge of blockchain technology.

To learn more about Tezos, see <https://tezos.com>.

To learn more about how Octez & the protocol fit into Tezos and its ecosystem, see :doc:`introduction/tezos`.

**Newcomer to Octez?** Start participating in Tezos using Octez!

Start participating in Tezos by following the ``Introduction`` section in the documentation menu.

These tutorials explain:

- how to :doc:`get the latest release of Octez <introduction/howtoget>` (a complete, open-source implementation of Tezos) in various forms,
- how to :doc:`start using Octez to join Tezos <introduction/howtouse>`,
- different :doc:`ways to participate to the network <introduction/howtorun>`,

and more.

**Already a user?** Here is everything you need to know!

If you already installed Octez and can participate in the Tezos blockchain, the most useful resources are grouped in the ``User manual`` section in the documentation menu.
These pages:

- present the key concepts and mechanisms for setting up Octez, including :doc:`user/setup-client`, :doc:`user/setup-node`, for different production or testing configurations;
- empowers you to take advantage of Octez' basic and more advanced features, such as :doc:`user/key-management`, :doc:`user/multisig`, :doc:`user/logging`, and much more.

If you intend to participate to Tezos not just as a user, but rather as a baker, you should also check more specialized documentation such as the  `Baking section on Open Tezos <https://opentezos.com/node-baking/overview/>`__.

**Want to know how it works?** It's no secret, let us explain!

If you want to know more about the *technology* underlying Octez and the Tezos protocol, the ``Reference manual`` section in the documentation present their rationale, main design principles, and some high-level implementation principles:

- Page ``Octez software architecture`` explains how the :ref:`architecture of the Octez implementation <packages>` instantiates the high-level :ref:`architectural principles of any Tezos implementation <the_big_picture>`, consisting in a "shell" and a "protocol" .

- Page ``Octez Shell`` details some major subsystems of :doc:`shell/shell`.

- Page ``Octez Protocol`` explains the design principles and the salient features of the Tezos protocol. In fact, these pages are versioned for several Tezos protocols, current or upcoming, such as: the :doc:`active protocol <active/protocol>`, a :doc:`protocol proposal under development <alpha/protocol>`, and possibly some protocol(s) that are currently candidate(s) for future adoption.

- Other pages are related to the important Smart Rollups feature, and present tools such as the Smart rollup node and Data Availability Committees.

**Are you a Tezos developer?** Find here some useful reference pages!

If you are a developer on the Tezos platform, you must know the `Tezos Developer Portal <https://tezos.com/developers/>`__ or `Open Tezos <https://opentezos.com>`__, giving accessible and pedagogical expositions on how to write smart contracts or Dapps.

This website complements those resources with reference documentation, mostly in section ``Developer reference``, including:

- Principles of the RPC interface such as the :doc:`developer/rpc`
- RPC references such as :doc:`shell/rpc`, :doc:`api/openapi`, or :doc:`api/errors`
- A complete reference of :doc:`active/michelson`
- Guidelines for writing smart contracts in Michelson, such as :doc:`active/michelson_anti_patterns`.

**Are you a platform developer?** Here are the nuts and bolts!

One major focus of this website is on resources for platform developers, that is, contributors to Octez (Octez developers) and contributors to the Tezos protocol (protocol developers).

Platform developers can find a rich set of explanations, tutorials, and howtos, mainly in the ``Contributing`` section, including:

- a tutorial on the various forms of contributing (:doc:`developer/contributing`), and guidelines such as :doc:`developer/guidelines`
- programming tutorials covering various libraries and frameworks specific to the Octez OCaml implementation, such as using :doc:`developer/gadt`, using :doc:`developer/error_monad`, using :doc:`developer/clic`, :doc:`developer/event_logging_framework`, etc.
- howtos for specific maintenance tasks such as :doc:`developer/michelson_instructions`, :doc:`developer/protocol_environment_upgrade`, or :doc:`developer/howto-freeze-protocols`
- a whole subsection on the :doc:`various testing frameworks <developer/testing_index>` for Octez, explaining how to use them and how to add different kinds of tests
- presentations of various tools for platform developers, such as support for :doc:`developer/profiling` and :doc:`developer/snoop`
- a subsection on :doc:`architecture details<developer/octez_architecture>` providing detailed explanations of the internal structure and design of key components in the Octez codebase.

Platform developers are also provided reference materials for internal APIs of Octez, such as:

- The :doc:`API of OCaml libraries and modules <api/api-inline>` reference
- The :doc:`shell/p2p_api` reference
- The :doc:`developer/merkle-proof-encoding-formats` reference.
