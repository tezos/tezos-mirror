RPCs - OpenAPI reference
========================

`OpenAPI <https://swagger.io/specification/>`_ is a specification format for REST APIs.
This format is supported by several tools, such as
`Swagger UI <https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/>`_ which allows you to browse
a specification and perform API calls from your browser.
Several code generators also exist to generate API libraries for various
programming languages.

Octez Node
~~~~~~~~~~

The REST API served by the Octez node on the RPC port is described by the union of several OpenAPI specifications:

- ``rpc-openapi(-rc).json``, containing the protocol-independent (or "shell") RPCs in the last (candidate) release
- ``rpc-openapi-dev.json``, containing the protocol-independent (or "shell") RPCs in the current development version (branch ``master``)
- For each protocol in use:

  + ``$PROTOCOL-openapi.json`` (served under the prefix: ``/chains/<chain-id>/blocks/<block-id>``)
  + ``$PROTOCOL-mempool-openapi.json`` (served under the prefix: ``/chains/<chain-id>/mempool``)

For instance, for an RPC listed as ``GET /filter`` in ``$PROTOCOL-mempool-openapi.json``, its real endpoint is ``GET /chains/<chain-id>/mempool/filter``.

These OpenAPI specifications, detailed below, can be generated by running the Octez node as shown in section :ref:`openapi_generate`.
For convenience, the files generated from the most recent release(s) are provided in this page, annotated each time with the corresponding release (in parentheses).

.. note::
    There exists an alternative reference for the node RPCs, presented in more static pages (e.g. :doc:`../active/rpc` for the active protocol).
    However, the static referece omits some RPCs, such as the ones related to the mempool.

Shell RPCs
----------

.. Note: the links currently point to master because no release branch
.. currently has the OpenAPI specification.
..
.. As soon as an actual release has this specification we should update
.. this section and the next one. The idea would be to link to all release tags,
.. and have an additional link at the top to the latest-release branch.
.. We'll probably remove the link to the specification for version 7.5 at this point
.. since it does not make sense to keep it in master forever.

The node provides some RPCs which are independent of the protocol.
Their OpenAPI specification can be found at:

- `rpc-openapi <../_static/rpc-openapi.html>`__ (version 22.1)
- `rpc-openapi-dev <../_static/rpc-openapi-dev.html>`__ (version master)

.. TODO tezos/tezos#2170: add/remove section(s)

Rio RPCs
--------

The OpenAPI specifications for RPCs which are specific to the Rio (``PsRiotum``)
protocol can be found at:

- `rio-openapi <../_static/rio-openapi.html>`__ (version 22.1)

The OpenAPI specifications for RPCs which are related to the mempool
and specific to the Rio protocol proposal can be found at:

- `rio-mempool-openapi <../_static/rio-mempool-openapi.html>`__ (version 22.1)

Alpha RPCs
----------

The OpenAPI specifications for RPCs which are specific to the Alpha
protocol can be found at:

- `alpha-openapi <../_static/alpha-openapi.html>`__ (version master)

The OpenAPI specifications for RPCs which are related to the mempool
and specific to the Alpha protocol can be found at:

- `alpha-mempool-openapi <../_static/alpha-mempool-openapi.html>`__ (version master)

Smart Rollup Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The smart rollup node exposes different RPCs depending on the underlying L1
protocol in use. Their specification is given in the sections below.
(The exact versions of the rollup node for which these files are produced can be
seen in the field ``.info.version`` within each file.)

.. TODO tezos/tezos#2170: add/remove section(s)

Rio RPCs
--------

The OpenAPI specifications for the RPCs of the smart rollup node for the Rio
(``PsRiotum``) protocol can be found at:

- `rio-smart-rollup-node-openapi <../_static/rio-smart-rollup-node-openapi.html>`__ (version 22.1)

Alpha RPCs
----------

The OpenAPI specifications for the RPCs of the smart rollup node for the Alpha
protocol can be found at:

- `alpha-smart-rollup-node-openapi <../_static/alpha-smart-rollup-node-openapi.html>`__ (version master)

DAL Node
~~~~~~~~

The DAL node also provides RPCs.
Their OpenAPI specification can be found at:

- `dal-node-openapi <../_static/dal-node-openapi.html>`__ (version 22.1)
- `dal-node-openapi <../_static/dal-node-openapi-dev.html>`__ (version master)

How to Generate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To regenerate the ``*-dev.json`` and ``alpha-*.json`` files above from the current sources in your Octez repository, run ``make -C docs openapi`` from the root of the Octez repository, which will run the generation script and check if the JSON files above are up-to-date with respect to their versions under Git (modulo the ``version`` fields inside).
If there are any significant differences, it will also render the corresponding JSON files as HTML.

Note that:

- The generation script ``src/bin_openapi/generate.sh`` requires the Octez executables to be built, so you have to first run ``make`` from the repository root.
- The HTML rendering script :src:`docs/scripts/openapi2html.sh` requires `yq <https://github.com/mikefarah/yq>`__ and `redocly <https://redocly.com>`__ to be installed.

For platform contributors: if you want to update the OpenAPI and HTML files in the official repository and documentation, you may create a merge request to update the changed files under ``docs/api/``.

Instead of executing all at once with the makefile, you may execute manually the generation or rendering, as follows.

OpenAPI generation
------------------

The OpenAPI generation script ``src/bin_openapi/generate.sh`` must be run
from the root of the Octez repository.

The generation script will start a sandbox node, activate the protocol,
get the RPC specifications from this node and convert them to OpenAPI specifications.

To generate the OpenAPI specification for the RPCs provided by a specific protocol instead of Alpha,
update the following variables in :src:`src/bin_openapi/generate.sh`:

```sh
protocol_hash=ProtoALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaDdp3zK
protocol_parameters=src/proto_alpha/parameters/sandbox-parameters.json
protocol_name=alpha
```

For ``protocol_hash``, use the value defined in ``TEZOS_PROTOCOL``.

HTML rendering
--------------

For generated OpenAPI files that changed, you may derive the corresponding statically-rendered HTML pages, typically using::

    docs/scripts/openapi2html.sh docs/api/*.json

How to Test
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can test OpenAPI specifications using `Swagger Editor <https://editor.swagger.io/>`_
to check for syntax issues (just copy-paste ``rpc-openapi.json`` into it or open
it from menu ``File > Import file``).

You can run `Swagger UI <https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/>`_ to get an interface
to browse the API (replace ``xxxxxx`` with the directory where ``rpc-openapi.json`` is,
and ``rpc-openapi.json`` by the file you want to browse)::

    docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-ui
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/mnt/rpc-openapi.json -v xxxxxx:/mnt swaggerapi/swagger-ui

Then `open it in your browser <https://localhost:8080>`_.
