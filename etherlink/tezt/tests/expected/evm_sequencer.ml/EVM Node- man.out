Snapshots commands:

  snapshot export 
    Export a snapshot of the EVM node.
    --data-dir <data-dir>: The path to the EVM node data directory
    --config-file <path>: Path to a configuration file. Defaults to
      `config.json` inside the data directory of the node.
    -s --snapshot-file <path>: Path to the snapshot file to create, with
      string interpolation. %r is replaced by the short form of the Smart
      Rollup address, %R by the complete Smart Rollup address, %l by the

      %% by %. Default is located in the current directory, and the filename
      is based on the snapshot information.
    --compress-on-the-fly: Produce a compressed snapshot on the fly. The
      rollup node will use less disk space to produce the snapshot but will
      lock the rollup node (if running) for a longer time. Without this
      option, producing a snaphsot requires the available disk space to be
      around the size of the data dir.
