    + chains/<chain_id>/
      - /tezlink/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block_id> <dynamic>
      - GET /tezlink/chains/<chain_id>/chain_id
          The chain unique identifier. 
      - GET /tezlink/chains/<chain_id>/is_bootstrapped
          The bootstrap status of a chain 
    - GET /tezlink/describe
        RPCs documentation and input/output schema 
    - POST /tezlink/injection/operation
        Inject an operation in node and broadcast it. Returns the ID of the
        operation. The `signedOperationContents` should be constructed using
        contextual RPCs from the latest block and signed by the client. The
        injection of the operation will apply it on the current mempool
        context. This context may change at each operation injection or
        operation reception from peers. By default, the RPC will wait for the
        operation to be (pre-)validated before returning. However, if ?async
        is true, the function returns immediately. The optional ?chain
        parameter can be used to specify whether to inject on the test chain
        or the main chain. 
    - GET /tezlink/monitor/bootstrapped
        Wait for the node to have synchronized its chain with a few peers
        (configured by the node's administrator), streaming head updates that
        happen during the bootstrapping process, and closing the stream at
        the end. If the node was already bootstrapped, returns the current
        head immediately. 
    - GET /tezlink/monitor/heads/<chain_id>
        Monitor all blocks that are successfully validated and applied by the
        node and selected as the new head of the given chain. 
    - GET /tezlink/version
        Get information on the node version 
  - GET /version
      version 


Dynamic parameter description:
  
  <block_id>
      A block identifier. This can take one of the following
      values:
	1.Block-hash - Hash in Base58Check notation.
	2.Alias - One of
      the following:'genesis/ head/ caboose/ savepoint/
      checkpoint'.
	3.Block-level - index(integer) in the chain.
	One can
      also specify the relative positions of block with respect to above
      three block identifiers. For ex. 'checkpoint~N' or checkpoint+N, where
      N is an integer, denotes the Nth block before(~) or after (+) the
      checkpoint. 
  <chain_id>
      A chain identifier. This is either a chain hash in Base58Check notation
      or a one the predefined aliases: 'main', 'test'.

        - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/<contract_id>/balance
            The spendable balance of a contract (in mutez), also known as
            liquid balance. Corresponds to tez owned by the contract that are
            neither staked, nor in unstaked requests, nor in frozen bonds.
            Identical to the 'spendable' RPC. 
        - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/<contract_id>/counter
            Access the counter of a contract, if any. 
        - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/<contract_id>/entrypoints

          Returns the expected issued tez for the provided block and the next
          'consensus_rights_delay' cycles (in mutez) 
      - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/context/raw/json/cycle/<block_cycle>
          Returns the cycle <i>. This RPC is a mock as there's no cycle
          notion in Tezlink and doesn't represent what's in the context of a
          block 
    - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/hash
        The block's hash, its unique identifier. 
    - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/header
        The whole block header. 
    - GET /chains/main/blocks/head/header/shell
        The shell-specific fragment of the block header.

          Returns the level of the interrogated block, or the one of a block
          located `offset` blocks after it in the chain. For instance, the

          Simulate running an operation at some future moment (based on the
          number of blocks given in the `latency` argument), and return the
          operation application result. The result is the same as
          run_operation except for the consumed gas, which depends on the
          contents of the cache at that future moment. This RPC estimates
          future gas consumption by trying to predict the state of the cache
          using some heuristics.
