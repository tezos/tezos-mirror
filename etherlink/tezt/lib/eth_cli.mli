    transaction deploying [bin] whose interface [abi] is registered in the
    client, and sends the raw transaction to the JSON-API server listening at
    [endpoint]. [bin] is a path to the binary file, and [abi] is the label used
    while registering the ABI in the client.

    This is a NOT transaction to be included in a block, but a simulation. It
    can be a state modifying transaction, in which case the modification are not
    included in a block. It can still be useful to test the result of a
    transaction before executing it "for real", however the result might be
    different as the state could change between testing and execution.

    example:

val get_block : block_id:string -> endpoint:string -> Block.t Lwt.t

(** [block_number ~endpoint] asks the current block number to the
    JSON-RPC API server listening at [endpoint]. *)
val block_number : endpoint:string -> int Lwt.t

(** [get_receipt ~endpoint ~tx] returns the [transaction_receipt] objects of a
    mined transaction if it exists. *)
val get_receipt :

(** [encode_method ~abi_label ~method_] returns the data corresponding to
