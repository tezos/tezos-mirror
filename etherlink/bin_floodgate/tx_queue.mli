(** The Tx_queue is a worker allowing to batch raw transactions in a single
    [eth_sendRawTransaction] at a regular interval. It provides a non-blocking
    interface based on the use of callbacks. *)

(** A [callback] is called by the [Tx_queue] at various stage of a submitted
    transaction life.

    The next tick after its insertion in the queue, a transaction is submitted
    to the relay node within a batch of [eth_sendRawTransaction] requests.

    {ul
      {li Depending on the result of the RPC, its [callback] is called with
          either [`Accepted hash] (where [hash] is the hash of the raw
          transaction) or [`Refused]).}
      {li As soon as the transaction appears in a blueprint, its callback is
          called with [`Confirmed]. If this does not happen before 2s, the
          [callback] is called with [`Dropped].}} *)

    raw transaction) and a {!callback} that will be used to advertise the
    transaction life cycle. *)

    the worker, meaning it is possible to call {!inject}, {!confirm}

    worker queue.

    transaction has been included in a blueprint. *)

    in the [Tx_queue] every [tick_interval] seconds. *)
val beacon : tick_interval:float -> unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** [transfer ?callback ~infos sender receiver value] inject a transaction
    moving [value] native tokens from [sender] to [receiver]. The nonce and
    balance of [receiver] (see {!Account.t}). Additionally, a [callback] can be
    provided, and will be called according to the transactionâ€™s lifecycle (see
    {!callback}). *)
