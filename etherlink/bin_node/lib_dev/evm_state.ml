(* The Fast Execution engine relies on Lwt_preemptive to execute Wasmer in
   dedicated worker threads (`Lwt_preemptive.detach`), while pushing to lwt
   event loop the resolutions of host functions (notably interacting with
   Irmin) (`Lwt_preemptive.run_in_main`).

   This means that parallel executions of the Etherlink kernel using the Fast
   Execution engine competes for the access of the event loop. In practice, it
   means it is possible for an attacker to slow down block production through
   RPC calls leading to execute the Etherlink kernel (typically,
   `eth_estimateGas`).

   Under the hood, `Lwt_preemptive` relies on a pool of 4 workers (implemented
   using native threads). With this patch, we ensure 1 of these workers is
   always available to the block production, by limiting the concurrent call to
   `execute_and_inspect` to 3. *)
