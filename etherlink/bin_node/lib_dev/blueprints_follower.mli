(** [start ~time_between_blocks ~evm_node_endpoint ~get_next_blueprint_number k]
    is a never-returning function which iterates over blueprints streamed by
    [evm_node_endpoint], calling [k] for each blueprint in order.

    [next_blueprint_number] is the height of the current local head, while
    [time_between_blocks] is used to detect when a connection to
    [evm_node_endpoint] is stalling.

    If [ping_tx_pool] is set to [true] (as it is if omitted), then the
    blueprint follower will ping the {!Tx_pool} for every blueprint it
    receives. Conversly, setting it to [false] allows to call [start] without a
    running {!Tx_pool}. *)
