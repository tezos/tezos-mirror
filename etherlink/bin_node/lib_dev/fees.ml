  On Etherlink, the gas serves two purposes:

    1. It provides a constraints on what can be executed by a given
       transaction.
    2. It accounts for the inclusion fees users pay to the sequencer for their
       transaction to be included on the parent chain.

   Each unit of gas is paid by the user with a base fee per gas. Contrary to
   other EVM chains, Etherlink has a minimum bas fee per gas in order to ensure
   that the sequencer will receive enough inclusion fees. The inclusion fees
   are a fixed cost per byte (in XTZ). So the higher the gas price, the less
   unit of gas are required to pay it.

   When it comes to computation involving fees, we consider the following input

     - [calldata] length from the transaction
     - [access_list] length from the transaction
     - [gas_limit] from the transaction
     - [minimum_base_fee_per_gas] the floor price for a gas unit
     - [base_fee_per_gas] the current price for a gas unit
     - [da_fee_per_byte] the constant price for a byte to include on the L1

   Based on the semantics introduced by Dionysus, we compute four values

     - [gas_used_for_da_fees] which is the number of gas units consumed to
       reimburse the sequencer, given the current [base_fee_per_gas]
     - [da_fees_overhead] is the amount of gas which a transaction needs to
       allocate in order for the sender to pay the inclusion fees when
       [base_fee_per_gas = minimum_base_fee_per_gas]. The kernel will however only
       consume the gas necessary to cover the inclusion fee for the current
       [base_fee_per_gas].
     - [execution_gas_limit = gas_limit - da_fees_overhead] computed by the
       kernel (since Dionysus) as the maximum amount of gas unit the
       transaction will be able to consume to be executed
     - [execution_gas = gas_used - gas_used_for_da_fees] the actual amount of
       gas unit used by the transaction.
