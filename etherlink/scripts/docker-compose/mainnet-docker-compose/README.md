This directory contains a script, a Docker Compose and an environment
file to start following the etherlink chain.

Note: This document does not explain how the smart rollup, smart
rollup node, EVM node, or the kernel works.

The provided docker-compose.yml assumes that the nodes have their data
directories initialized (with the configuration and snapshot
imported).

The script init.sh handles the initialization of all node states using
snapshots. You can run it with ./init.sh. This will bootstrap the
three necessary nodes:

    octez-node, which follows the Tezos mainnet chain.
    octez-smart-rollup-node, which follows the smart rollup 'etherlink'.
    octez-evm-node, which follows the EVM mainnet chain 'etherlink'.

The .env file defines the default values necessary to run the Docker
Compose setup. By default, it stores the node data in the directory
$PWD/.etherlink-mainnet-data, but this can be customized with the
environment variable HOST_TEZOS_DATA_DIR.

Refer to the .env file to check any configurable variables for the EVM
node. If an option is not yet covered, you can explore the available
configuration with `docker-compose run observer describe config`, or
view command-line options using `docker-compose run observer run
--help`.

At the time of this fileâ€™s last update, the following versions are
used for each binary:

    Octez-evm-node: Octez EVM node release 0.12
    Octez-node: Octez Release 21
    Octez-smart-rollup-node: Octez Release 21

Please ensure you use the latest available versions and update the
tags in the .env file accordingly.
