  (** {2 Folding} *)

  (** [fold ?depth t root ~order ~init ~f] recursively folds over the trees

      to [root]. [f] is never called with an empty key for values; i.e.,
      folding over a value is a no-op.

      The depth is 0-indexed. If [depth] is set (by default it is not), then [f]
      is only called when the conditions described by the parameter is true:

      - [Eq d] folds over nodes and contents of depth exactly [d].
      - [Lt d] folds over nodes and contents of depth strictly less than [d].
      - [Le d] folds over nodes and contents of depth less than or equal to [d].
      - [Gt d] folds over nodes and contents of depth strictly more than [d].
      - [Ge d] folds over nodes and contents of depth more than or equal to [d].

      If [order] is [`Sorted] (the default), the elements are traversed in
      lexicographic order of their keys. For large nodes, it is memory-consuming,
      use [`Undefined] for a more memory efficient [fold]. *)

      Trees are immutable and non-persistent (they disappear if the
      host crash), held in memory for efficiency, where reads are done
      lazily and writes are done only when needed, e.g. on
      [Context.commit]. If a key is modified twice, only the last
