      This is expected to be used as follows:

      - A first peer runs a function [f] over a tree [t]. While performing
        this computation, it records: the hash of [t] (called [before]
        below), the hash of [f t] (called [after] below) and a subset of [t]
        which is needed to replay [f] without any access to the first peer's
        storage. Once done, all these informations are packed into a proof of
        type [t] that is sent to the second peer.

      - The second peer generates an initial tree [t'] from [p] and computes
        [f t']. Once done, it compares [t']'s hash and [f t']'s hash to [before]
        and [after]. If they match, they know that the result state [f t'] is a

  (** The type for (internal) inode proofs.

      These proofs encode large directories into a tree-like structure. This
      reflects irmin-pack's way of representing nodes and computing
      hashes (tree-like representations for nodes scales better than flat
      representations).

      [length] is the total number of entries in the children of the inode.
      It's the size of the "flattened" version of that inode. [length] can be
      used to prove the correctness of operations such [Tree.length] and
      [Tree.list ~offset ~length] in an efficient way.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = false], an inode at depth 0 has a
      [length] of at least [257]. Below that threshold a [Node] tag is used in
      [tree]. That threshold is [3] when [version.is_binary = true].

      [proofs] contains the children proofs. It is a sparse list of ['a] values.
      These values are associated to their index in the list, and the list is
      kept sorted in increasing order of indices. ['a] can be a concrete proof
      or a hash of that proof.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = true], inodes have at most 2 proofs
      (indexed 0 or 1).

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = false], inodes have at most 32 proofs

      An extender is a compact representation of a sequence of [inode] which
      contain only one child. As for inodes, The ['a] parameter can be a

      If an inode proof contains singleton children [i_0, ..., i_n] such as:
      [{length=l; proofs = [ (i_0, {proofs = ... { proofs = [ (i_n, p) ] }})]}],
      then it is compressed into the inode extender
      [{length=l; segment = [i_0;..;i_n]; proof=p}] sharing the same lenght [l]
      and final proof [p]. *)

      Tree proofs do not provide any guarantee with the ordering of

      distinguishable by this kind of proofs.

      [Value v] proves that a value [v] exists in the store.

      [Blinded_value h] proves a value with hash [h] exists in the store.

      [Node ls] proves that a a "flat" node containing the list of files [ls]
      exists in the store.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = true], the length of [ls] is at most
      2.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = false], the length of [ls] is at most
      256.

      [Blinded_node h] proves that a node with hash [h] exists in the store.

  module Stream = struct
    (** Stream proofs represent an explicit traversal of a Merle tree proof.
        Every element (a node, a value, or a shallow pointer) met is first
        "compressed" by shallowing its children and then recorded in the proof.

        As stream proofs directly encode the recursive construction of the
        Merkle root hash is slightly simpler to implement: verifier simply
        need to hash the compressed elements lazily, without any memory or
        choice.

        Moreover, the minimality of stream proofs is trivial to check.
        Once the computation has consumed the compressed elements required,
        it is sufficient to check that no more compressed elements remain
        in the proof.

        However, as the compressed elements contain all the hashes of their
        shallow children, the size of stream proofs is larger
        (at least double in size in practice) than tree proofs, which only
        contains the hash for intermediate shallow pointers. *)

      should be expecting.

      Therefore, contrary to trees found in a storage, the contents of the trees
      passed to [f] may not be available. For this reason, looking up a value at

        [path] as an invalid path (see below).
