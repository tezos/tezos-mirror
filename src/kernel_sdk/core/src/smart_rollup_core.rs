/// # Error handling
/// Most functions in *SmartRollupCore* return `i32`. When used correctly, this
/// result will tend to be positive (for example to represent the number of
/// bytes read/written to/from memory.)
///
/// There may be situtations where a host function does return an error (for
/// example `store_read` on a non-existent value would return an error). As
/// a result, you should be careful to check for possible errors after calling
/// host functions.
///
/// A full list of error codes is given in the [top-level](./lib.rs).
