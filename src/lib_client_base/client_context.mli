(** This module contains several class types used to provide I/O
    services for the client, the wallet, etc.

    This interface is independent of the backend. This is intended for the client
    library code, so it can be independent of the backend. The client, and each
    other client-like systems (wallet apps, in-browser widgets, etc.), are
    responsible for providing a backend-specific implementation.

    To find examples on how these methods are called, you can have a look at
    - src/bin_client/client_protocols_commands.ml
    - src/lib_client_base/client_aliases.ml
    - src/lib_client_base_unix/client_context_unix.ml

    provide small classes that are also combined into bigger
    classes. It allows different client library functions to only
    depend on some features, but not all, so that these functions
    can be used in places that only have access to these
