(* In order to keep this algorithm reasonably efficient even for large
   expressions, it is written in a tail-recursive manner. This means that
   no node can descend into a recursive call directly to diff its children.
   Instead a queue of nodes to be processed is maintained and any children
   a node might have are pushed into this queue to be processed later.
   [dequeue] and [diff_step] functions are responsible for this.

   This means that the algorithm also needs to maintain a state in order to
   know how to build the resulting expression. This state has the form of
   a stack (see [state] and [state_stack] types). Each item on the stack
   represents a [Seq] or a [Prim] node currently being built. Multiple levels
   that might exist on the stack represent nesting of those nodes.

   Whenever a [Seq] or a [Prim] node is discovered in both versions of the
   expression, a corresponding item is added to the stack and all the children
   of both nodes are paired in order and pushed into the queue (see [diff_item]
   type and [zip_nodes] function). The queue is organised in levels (represented
   as a list of lists). When a level is finished, one level of the stack is
   folded into a complete expression, which is then added to the accumulator a
   level up, from where it'll be included in the encompassing expression when
   that is finished (see [fold_stack_level] function).

   Eventually there will be no more nodes to dequeue, at which point all the
   remaining stack levels are folded and the final result is produced. *)
