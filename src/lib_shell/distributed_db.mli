(** Tezos Shell - High-level API for the Gossip network and local storage.

    It provides functions to query *static* resources such as blocks headers,
    operations, and functions to access dynamic resources such as heads and
    chains.

    Several chains (mainchain, testchain, ...) can be managed independently.
    First a chain is activated using [activate], which provides a
    [chain_db] from which it is possible to access resources.
    Eventually the chain is deactivated using [deactivate].

    Static resources are accessible via "Requester" modules ([Block_header],
    [Operation], [Operations], [Protocol]). These modules act as read-through
    caches in front of the local storage [State] and the p2p layer. They
    centralize concurrent requests, and cache results in memory. They don't
    update [State] directly.

    For instance, from a block_header hash, one can fetch the actual block
    header using [Block_header.fetch], then the block operations with
    [Operations.fetch].

(** The first call to [activate t chain callbacks] activates [chain],
   creates a [chain_db] and sends a [Get_current_branch chain_id]
   message to all neighbors, where [chain_id] is the identifier of
   [chain]. This informs the neighbors that this node expects
   notifications for new heads/mempools. The given [callbacks] are
   given to the [P2p_reader] for each [peer]:

    - [notify_branch peer locator] is called when the [P2p_reader]
   receives the message [Current_branch (chain, locator)] from peer
   [peer].

    - [notify_head peer head] is called when the [P2p_reader] receives
   the message [Current_head (chain, head, mempool)] from peer [peer].

    - [Disconnection peer] is called when the [P2p_reader] receives
   the message [Deactivate chain] from peer [peer] or when the
   [P2p_reader] associated to [peer] is shutdown.

    Subsequent calls simply return the existing [chain_db]. *)
