}

(** [create limits ddb bvp start_testchain] creates a
   [Block_validator].

    - [limits] contains various [timeout] limits.

    - [ddb] is used to commit a block on the storage and get the state
   of the chain for which the block is submitted to validation.

    - [bvp] is an instance of the [Block_validator_process]. [bvp] is
   a proxy between the shell and the validation part related to the
   economic protocol (See [Block_validator_process]).

    - [start_testchain] if set to true allows to run the [testchain].


    This function is not supposed to fail. It is implemented this way
   because of the interface implemented by the [Worker] module. *)

(** [validate_and_apply ?canceler ?peer ?notify_new_block
    ~advertise_after_validation validator ddb hash header ops] validates a block
    [header] [ops] of hash [hash]. It is a no-op in the following cases:

    - If the block has already been validated.

    - If the block level is before the [savepoint]

    Otherwise it calls the [Block_validator_process] process
   associated to the current [validator].

    - [advertise_after_validation] if set to true, the block is
    advertised to its peers after its validation. It aims to be set to
    false during bootstrapping.

    - [canceler] is triggered when the validation of a block fails.

    - [peer] is the peer which sent the block.

    If the validation succeeded it processes as follows:

    1. The [ddb] commits the block on the storage.

    2. If the next block requires a switch of protocol, it tries to
   fetch and precompile the next protocol.

    3. Call [notify_new_block] with the committed [block].


    An error is raised if the validation failed or if the block was
   already known as invalid. However, if the first [validation]
   attempt failed because the protocol was missing, it tries to
   [fetch] and [download] the protocol before trying to validate the
   block a second time.

    application resulted is cached to avoid re-apply the block if the
    next call block validation, through [validate], targets the same
    block.

    An error is raised if the pre-apply failed. However, if the first
    [pre-apply] attempt failed because the protocol was missing, it
    tries to [fetch] and [download] the protocol before trying to
    pre-apply the block a second time. *)
