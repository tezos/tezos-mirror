(** Overview:

   The [bootstrap_pipeline] is a promise which is fulfilled when all
   block hashes of a locator has been valided. It is canceled if one
   of the three premises above fails.

   The promise "fetching headers" fetches headers step by step (a
   locator being a list of steps). [steps] are processed bottom to
   top. A [step] is a subchain delimited by two block hashes. A
   subchain being a list of block [[b1;...;bn]] such that [bi.pred] =
   hash([bj]) where i = j + 1. Headers are fetched from the
   [distributed_db] top to bottom but are enqueued in the [pipe]
   bottom to top.  The promise is fulfilled if every hashes contain in
   the locator steps were successfuly enqueued in the [pipe]. The
   promise is canceled if an error from the [distrubted_db] is raised,
   or if the [locator] was invalid.

   The promise "fetching operations" dequeue block headers and for
   each block header fetches the operations contained in the
   block. Once all the operations are fetched, it enqueues the headers
   and the operations in a [pipe] used by the promise validating
   blocks. This promise is fulfilled when it fetches all the
   operations for all the blocks that were in the input [pipe]. It is
   canceled if the [distributed_db] raised an error.

   The promise "validating blocks" dequeue full blocks and give them
   to the [Block_validator]. The promise is fulfilled is all blocks
   were validated successfuly. It is canceled otherwise. *)

(** An event is trigerred when the node is fetching large steps of a
   [Block_locator] from the network. A large step is defined by
   [big_step_size]. In that case an event is made every
   [big_step_size_announced]. *)
let big_step_size, big_step_size_announce = (2000, 1000)

(** The promises which fetches headers and operations communicate
   through a [Lwt_pipe.Bounded]. This pipe stores headers by batch. The size
   of the batch is defined by [header_batch_size]. *)
let header_batch_size = 20

(** Size of the [Lwt_pipe.Bounded] containing the fetched headers. If this
   size is reached, the promise which fetches headers holds and wait
   that the promise which fetches operations to dequeue some
   headers. This means that the maximum number of headers the queue
   can contain is [fetched_headers_queue_size] *
   [batch_header_size]. *)
let fetched_headers_queue_size = 1024

(** Size of the queue containing a full blocks (block + operations)
   before they are processed by the [Block_validator]. *)

    - The timestamp of the block is more than s seconds in the
   future, where s is specified by the module Clock_drift.

    - The block is at the same level as the checkpoint, but they are
   different.

    - The checkpoint has been reached (that is, the head of the chain
   is past the checkpoint) but the block is not yet in the chain. *)

(** [fetch_step] fetches block headers given a [Block_locator.step]
   and returns them as a list. It fetches headers iteratively starting
   from the top block down to the bottom block. Blocks are returned in
   the reverse order. At each iteration, the function does the
   following:

    1. First, it does some sanity check to ensure that the locator is
   valid.

    2. Then it asks to the [Distributed_db] for the block header
   associated to the hash of the block.

    3. It checks whether the received header is acceptable.

    4. It loops on the predecessor of the current block. *)
