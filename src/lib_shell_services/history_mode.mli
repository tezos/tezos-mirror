(** History modes for the chain history storage

   History modes allow a node to require less disk storage. Indeed,
    depending on the chosen history mode, some parts of the complete
    chain history can be deleted as they are not required
    anymore. Three history modes are provided:

    - Full: The node stores the minimal data since
    the genesis required to reconstruct (or 'replay') the complete
    chain's ledger state.

    - Rolling (default mode): This is the lightest mode as it only
    maintains a minimal rolling fragment of the chain data so the node can
    still validate new blocks and synchronize with the head.

    - Archive: This is the heaviest mode as it keeps the whole chain
    data to be able to query any information stored on the chain since
    the genesis. It is particularly suitable for indexers or block
    explorers.
