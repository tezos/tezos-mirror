(** [main ~name ~cctxt ~stream ~state_maker ~pre_loop ~timeout_maker ~timeout_k
    ~event_k] is an infinitely running loop that
    monitors new events arriving on [stream]. The loop exits when the
    [stream] gives an error.

    The function [pre_loop] is called before the loop starts.

    The loop maintains a state (of type ['state]) initialized by [state_maker]
    and passed to the callbacks [timeout_maker] (used to set up waking-up
    timeouts), [timeout_k] (when a computed timeout happens), and [event_k]
    (when a new event arrives on the stream).
