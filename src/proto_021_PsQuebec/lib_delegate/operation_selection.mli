    [application_state]) and filter them regarding the quota of each validation
    pass. Manager operations are prioritized based on a weight computed from
    their fees/gas/bytes. [filter_operations_with_simulation] function returns a
    [simulation_result], containing the validated operation, their resulting
    [operations_hash], optional [validation_result] and [block_header_metadata]
    if the operations were applied. *)
