Scenario T3

1. There are four nodes: A, B, C, and D.
2. C is the proposer at the round 0. It sends the proposal, which is
   received by all bakers except for D.
3. Due to how the messages propagate, only B sees 3 preattestations. It
   attests and locks. Other nodes all see fewer than 3 preattestations.

   A -> A and B
   B -> B
   C -> C and B

4. D proposes at the round 1. Its message reaches 3 nodes, including B.

   D -> D, B, C

5. B does not preattest because it is locked.
6. No decision is taken at the round 1.
7. B proposes at the round 2. There are no more problems with propagation of
   messages, so a decision is reached.

Scenario F1

1. Node C (bootstrap3) proposes at level 1 round 0, its proposal reaches all
   nodes.
2. Propagation of preattestations happens in such a way that only Node A
   (bootstrap1) observes PQC:

   A -> A
   B -> B and A
   C -> C and A
   D -> D and A

   Node A locks.

3. At the level 1 round 1 node D (bootstrap4) proposes. Propagation of
   messages is normal.

4. Node A (bootstrap1) should propose at level 2 round 0.

Scenario M5

1. There are four bakers: A, B, C, and D.
2. A proposes at level 1 round 0. Its proposal reaches A, B, C, and D, but with
   a delay of 1 second. There are no problems with propagation of
   preattestations and attestations.
3. At the level 1 all four bakers have proposer slots, however we block possible
   proposals from B and C at higher rounds.
4. Check that D proposes at the level 2 round 0, which means that it has
   observed QC.
