(** From the current [state], the function returns an Lwt promise that
    fulfills once the nearest timeout is expired and at which the state
    machine will react.

    Both subfunctions [wait_baking_time] and [wait_end_of_round] are
    using the blocking function
    [Baking_scheduling.sleep_until]. However, this call is binded into
    a Lwt promise. Hence, it just won't get fulfilled until sleep time
    has elapsed. Once the promise is fulfilled,
    [Baking_scheduling.wait_next_event] handles with [Lwt.choose] to
