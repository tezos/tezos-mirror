(** A module for managing state concerning a rollup's outbox. *)

(** [record_applied_message ctxt rollup level ~message_index] marks the message
    in the outbox of rollup [rollup] at level [level] and position
    [message_index] as processed. Returns the size diff resulting from adding an
    entry. The size diff may be 0 if an entry already exists, or negative if an
    index is replaced with a new level.

    An attempt to apply an old level that has already been replaced fails with
    an [Sc_rollup_outbox_level_expired] error.

    In case a message has already been applied for the given level and message
    index, the function fails with an [Sc_rollup_outbox_message_already_applied]
    error. *)
