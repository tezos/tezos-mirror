(** [finalize_unstake ctxt ~for_next_cycle_use_only_after_slashing contract]
    performs the finalization of all unstake requests from [contract] that can
    be finalized.
    An unstake request can be finalized if it is old enough, specifically the
    requested amount must not be at stake anymore and must not be slashable
    anymore, i.e. after [consensus_rights_delay + max_slashing_period] after the
    request.
    Amounts are transferred from the [contract]'s delegate (at request time)
    unstaked frozen deposits to [contract]'s spendable balance, minus slashing
    the requested stake undergone in between.

    If [for_next_cycle_use_only_after_slashing] is true, the finalization is
    done for the next cycle. It is meant to be used only at cycle end after the
