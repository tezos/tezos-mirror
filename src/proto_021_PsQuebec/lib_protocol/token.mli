(** The aim of this module is to manage operations involving tokens such as
    minting, transferring, and burning. Every constructor of the types [giver],
    [container], or [receiver] represents a kind of account that holds a given (or
    possibly infinite) amount of tokens.

    Tokens can be transferred from a [giver] to a [receiver]. To uniformly handle
    all cases, special constructors of givers and receivers may be used. For
    example, the giver [`Minted] is used to express a transfer of minted tokens
    to a receiver, and the receiver [`Burned] is used to express the action of
    burning a given amount of tokens taken from a giver. Thanks to uniformity,
    it is easier to track transfers of tokens throughout the protocol by running
    [grep -R "Token.transfer" src/proto_alpha].

    For backward compatibility purpose, an ANTI-PATTERN is used to redistribute
    slashing to denunciator; this redistribution technic should not be mimicked
    if it can be avoided (see https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/4787).
    The anti-pattern works as follows:
    The part of slashed amounts that goes to the author of the denunciation are
    not directly distributed to him. Tokens are transferred to a burning sink,
    then minted from an infinite source ( see `Double_signing_punishments,
    and `Sc_rollup_refutation_rewards ).
    Again, this is an ANTI-PATTERN that should not be mimicked.
*)

(** [container] is the type of token holders with finite capacity, and whose assets
    are contained in the context. An account may have several token holders,
    that can serve as sources and/or sinks.
    For example, an implicit account [d] serving as a delegate has a token holder
    for its own spendable balance, and another token holder for its frozen deposits.

        be revealed to unlock the funds *)
  | `Frozen_deposits of Frozen_staker_repr.t
    (** Frozen tokens of a staker for consensus security deposits. *)
  | `Unstaked_frozen_deposits of Unstaked_frozen_staker_repr.t * Cycle_repr.t
    (** Frozen tokens of a contract that have been unstaked at the
        given cycle. *)

  | `Frozen_bonds of Contract_repr.t * Bond_id_repr.t
    (** Frozen tokens of a contract for bond deposits (currently used by rollups) *)

 ** of infinite capacity. *)

    containers are considered to have infinite capacity. *)

    containers are considered to have infinite capacity. *)

    carbonated data, and the balance associated to the token holder.
    This function may fail if [allocated ctxt container] returns [false].
    Returns an error with the message "get_balance" if [container] refers to an
    originated contract that is not allocated.

    This function is only defined on the few cases for which it is
    actually needed. *)

    as though [transfer ?origin ctxt giver receiver amount] was invoked for each pair
    [(giver, amount)] in [givers], however a single balance update is generated
    for the total amount transferred to [receiver].
    When [givers] is an empty list, the function does nothing to the context,
    and returns an empty list of balance updates. *)

    balance is less than [amount].
    Returns a [Subtraction_underflow] error if [giver] is
    not a contract and its balance is less than [amount].
    Returns a [Empty_implicit_delegated_contract] error if [giver] is an
    implicit contract that delegates to a different contract, and whose balance
    is equal to [amount].
    Returns a [Non_existing_contract] error if
    [receiver] refers to an originated contract that is not allocated.
    Returns a [Non_existing_contract] error if [amount <> Tez_repr.zero], and
    [receiver] refers to an originated contract that is not allocated.
    Returns a [Addition_overflow] error if [receiver] refers to a receiver whose balance
    is greater than [Int64.max - amount].

    not the current level. *)
