   an RPC for the rollup node to look for a new conflict to solve. *)

(** [start_game ctxt rollup ~player:(player, player_commitment_hash)

    between [player] and [opponent] in the given [rollup] as they are in
    conflict with [commitment] and [opponent_commitment]. Where [commitment] is
    the commitment in the storage with hash [player_commitment_hash]

(** [game_move ctxt rollup player opponent refutation]
    handles the storage-side logic for when one of the players makes a
    move in the game. It checks the game already exists. Then it checks
    that [player] is the player whose turn it is; if so, it applies
    [refutation] using the [play] function.

    If the result is a new game, this is stored and the timeout is updated.

    May fail with:
    {ul
      {li [Sc_rollup_does_not_exist] if [rollup] does not exist}
      {li [Sc_rollup_no_game] if [is_opening_move] is [false] but the
         game does not exist}
      {li [Sc_rollup_game_already_started] if [is_opening_move] is [true]
         but the game already exists}
      {li [Sc_rollup_no_conflict] if [player] is staked on an ancestor of
         the commitment staked on by [opponent], or vice versa}
      {li [Sc_rollup_not_staked] if one of the [player] or [opponent] is
         not actually staked}
      {li [Sc_rollup_staker_in_game] if one of the [player] or [opponent]
         is already playing a game}
      {li [Sc_rollup_wrong_turn] if a player is trying to move out of
         turn}
    }

    The [is_opening_move] argument is included here to make sure that an
    operation intended to start a refutation game is never mistaken for
    an operation to play the second move of the game---this may
    otherwise happen due to non-deterministic ordering of L1 operations.
    With the [is_opening_move] parameter, the worst case is that the
    operation simply fails. Without it, the operation would be mistaken
    for an invalid move in the game and the staker would lose their
    stake! *)

(** [timeout ctxt rollup stakers] checks that the timeout has
    elapsed and if this function returns a game result that punishes whichever
    of [stakers] is supposed to have played a move.

    The timeout period is defined a protocol constant, see
    {!Constants_storage.sc_rollup_timeout_period_in_blocks}.

    May fail with:
    {ul
      {li [Sc_rollup_no_game] if the game does not in fact exist}
      {li [Sc_rollup_timeout_level_not_reached] if the player still has
         time in which to play}
    }

    Note: this function takes the two stakers as a pair rather than
    separate arguments. This reflects the fact that for this function
    the two players are symmetric. This function will normalize the
    order of the players if necessary to get a valid game index, so the
    argument [stakers] doesn't have to be in normal form. *)

(** [apply_game_result ctxt rollup game_result] takes a [game_result] produced
    by [timeout] or [game_move] and performs the necessary end-of-game
    cleanup: remove the game itself from the store and punish the losing
    player by removing their stake. In the case where the game ended in
    a draw, both players are slashed.

    This is mostly just calling [remove_staker], so it can fail with the
    same errors as that. However, if it is called on an [game_result]
    generated by [game_move] or [timeout] it should not fail.
