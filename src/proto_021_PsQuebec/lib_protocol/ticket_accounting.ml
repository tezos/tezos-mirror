   - [old_storage_strict] the amount S_1^{strict} of ticket-tokens in the strict part of
     the old storage.

   - [new_storage_strict] the amount S_2^{strict} of ticket-tokens in the strict part of the
      new storage.

   - [lazy_storage_diff] the amount S_{\delta}^{lazy} of ticket-tokens added to the lazy part of
      the storage.

   - [arg_tickets] the amount I of ticket-tokens contained in the incoming
     arguments.

    We calculate the ticket diff as the following:
    [new_storage_strict] + [lazy_storage_diff] - ([old_storage_strict] + [arg_tickets])

    Additionally, we calculate the ticket receipt as below.
    We do not subtract the [arg_tickets] since we only want to display the tickets updated in storage for the receipt.
    [new_storage_strict] + [lazy_storage_diff] - [storage_strict]
