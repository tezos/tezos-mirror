(** A commitment represents a claim about the state of the Inbox and PVM at
    some Inbox level.

    More formally, a commitment is a claim that:

    {ul
      {li assuming the PVM and Inbox are in a state implied by [predecessor]}
      {li the PVM consumes all the messages until (and including) [inbox_level]
          from the inbox ; }
      {li the PVM advances to the state [compressed_state] over
          [number_of_ticks] ticks. }
    }

    Commitments are disjoint. The next correct commitment is a function of the
    previous machine state and Inbox.

    [compressed_state] and [number_of_ticks] can be proven/disproven by PVM
    execution, or equivalently, by an interactive proof game between
    conflicting parties, such that a correct executor always wins the game.

  (** [genesis_commitment ~origination_level ~genesis_state_hash] is the

      [compressed_state] is computed after the boot sector is set. It has the
      following values:

      {ul {li [compressed_state] = [genesis_state_hash]}
