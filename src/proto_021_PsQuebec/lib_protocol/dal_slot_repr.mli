    {1 Overview}

    For the data-availability layer, the L1 provides a list of slots
   at every level. A slot is a blob of data that can be interpreted by
   the users of the data-availability layer (such as SCORU).

    The purpose of the data-availability layer is to increase the
   bandwidth of the layer 1 thanks to the distribution of "slots". A
   slot is never posted directly onto the layer 1 blocks but on the
   data-availability layer. The producer of a slot still has to post a
   slot header onto the layer 1. A slot header is an abstract datatype
   certifying that the corresponding slot has some maximum size
   (provided by the layer 1). In other words, the whole data contained
   into the slot cannot exceed some fixed size. This is to avoid
   attacks where a slot header would be posted onto the layer 1 block,
   declared available by the protocol, but actually the slot size
   would be too large to be refuted a posteriori.

   The slot header can also be used to prove that a blob of data is a
   portion of the initial slot. *)

end

(** This module provides an abstract data structure (type {!History.t}) that
    represents a skip list used to store successive DAL slots confirmed/attested
    on L1. There is one slot per cell in the skip list. The slots are sorted in
    increasing order by level, and by slot index, for the slots of the same
    level.

    This module also defines a bounded history cache (type
    {!type-History.History_cache.t}) that allows to remember recent values of a
    skip list of type {!History.t} (indexed by the skip lists' hashes). This
    structure is meant to be maintained and used by the rollup node to produce
    refutation proofs involving DAL slot inputs.

    Note on terminology: "confirmed slot" is another name for "attested slot".

  (** The genesis skip list that contains one dummy cell. This cell has
      {!Raw_level_repr.root} as published level and no attested slots. Since Dal
      is not necessarily activated in the genesis block (e.g. this will be the case
      on mainnet), the skip list is reset at the first call to
      {!add_confirmed_slot_headers} to enforce the invariant that there are no gaps
      in the levels of the cells of the skip list.

      So, a skip list is initialized with this genesis cell. It's then replaced
      with a growing (non-dummy) skip list as soon as a call to
      {!add_confirmed_slot_headers} with a level bigger than
      {!Raw_level_repr.root} is performed. This allows to activate Dal at any
      level and having a contiguous skip list (w.r.t. L1 levels). This
      representation allows to produce simpler proofs with a bounded history
      cache. *)

  (** The [History_cache.t] structure is basically a bounded lookup table of
      {!t} skip lists. (See {!Bounded_history_repr.S}). In the L1 layer, the
      capacity (bound) is set to zero (nothing is remembered). By contrast,
      the rollup node uses a history cache with a (sufficiently) large capacity
      to participate in all potential refutation games occurring during the
      challenge period. Indeed, the successive recent skip-lists stored in
      the cache are needed to produce proofs involving slots' pages. *)

  (** When a SCORU kernel's inputs come from the DAL, they are provided as
      pages' content for confirmed slots, or None in case the slot doesn't
      exist or is not confirmed.

      In a refutation game involving an import tick of a Dal page input, a
      honest user should be able to provide:

      - When the PVM is requesting a page of a confirmed slot: a proof that the
      slot is confirmed, in addition to needed information to check that the
      page (whose id and content are given) is part of the slot;

      - When the opponent pretends that the PVM is requesting a page of some
      unconfirmed slot, but that slot is not published or not confirmed on L1:
      a proof that the slot (whose id is given via the page's id) cannot be
      confirmed on L1.

  (** [produce_proof dal_parameters page_id page_info ~get_history slots_hist]

        the page identified by [page_id] whose data and slot inclusion proof
        are given by [page_info], or
      - there cannot exist a confirmed slot in the skip list (whose head is
        given by [slots_hist]) containing the page identified by [page_id].

      In the first case above, [page_info] should contain the page's content
      and the proof that the page is part of the (confirmed) slot whose
      id is given in [page_id]. In the second case, no page content or proof
      should be provided, as they are not needed to construct a non-confirmation
      proof.

      The function returns an error in case the slot is not confirmed but the
      page's content and proof are given. It also fails if the slot is confirmed
      but no or bad information about the page are provided.

      Note that, in case the level of the page is far in the past (the Dal skip
      list was not populated yet or the slots of the associated level are not
      valid anymore) should be handled by the caller.
