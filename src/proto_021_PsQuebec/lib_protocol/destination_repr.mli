(** The type of the [destination] argument of the
    {!Operation_repr.Transaction} manager operation.

    The introduction of this type allows to interact with emerging
    layer-2 solutions using the API Tezos users and tooling
    are already used to: contract calls to entrypoint. These solutions
    cannot be integrated to {!Contract_repr.t} directly, because
    values of this type are given a balance, which has an impact on
    the delegation system. *)

(** This type is a superset of the set of contracts ({!Contract_repr.t}).

    {b Note:} It is of key importance that the encoding of this type
    remains compatible with {!Contract_repr.encoding}, for the
    introduction to this type to remain transparent from the existing
    tooling perspective.  *)
