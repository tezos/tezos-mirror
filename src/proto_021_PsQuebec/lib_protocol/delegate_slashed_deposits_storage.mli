(** This module handles the slashing of delegates for double signing.

    It is behind the {!Alpha_context} abstraction: some functions are
    re-exported in {!Alpha_context.Delegate}.

    This module is responsible for maintaining the
    {!Storage.Contract.Slashed_deposits} table. It also interacts
    heavily with {!Pending_denunciations_storage}.
*)

(** The [reward_and_burn] type embeds amounts involved when slashing a
    delegate for double attesting or double baking. *)
type reward_and_burn = {reward : Tez_repr.t; amount_to_burn : Tez_repr.t}

(** The [punishing_amounts] type embeds amounts involved when slashing a
    delegate for double attesting or double baking. *)
type punishing_amounts = {
  staked : reward_and_burn;
  unstaked : (Cycle_repr.t * reward_and_burn) list;
}

(** Record in the context that the given delegate is both marked for
    slashing for the given misbehaviour, and forbidden from taking
    part in the consensus process (baking/attesting).

    [operation_hash] corresponds to the denunciation that prompted
    this punishment. The level argument is the level of the duplicate
    blocks, or the level that the duplicate (pre)attestations point
    to, **not** the level of the block that contains the denunciation.

    This function asserts that the delegate has not already been
    denounced for the same misbehaviour at the same level. Indeed, if
    this were the case, then the current denunciation operation should
    have been rejected by {!Validate}. *)

(** Applies pending denunciations in {!Storage.Pending_denunciations}
    at the end of a cycle. The applicable denunciations are those that
    point to a misbehavior whose max slashable period is ending.
    (because [max_slashable_period = 2], the misbehavior must be
    in the previous cycle).

    The denunciations are applied in chronological order of misbehaviour.
    This function slashes the misbehaving bakers, by a proportion defined
    in {!Slash_percentage}, and updates the respective
    {!Storage.Contract.Slashed_deposits}. The applied denunciations are
    removed from the storage.

    It returns the updated context, and all the balance updates,
    which includes slashes for the bakers, the stakers, and the rewards
    for the denouncers.
