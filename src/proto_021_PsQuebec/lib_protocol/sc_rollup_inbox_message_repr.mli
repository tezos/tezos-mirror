(** This module exposes a type {!t} that represents inbox messages. Inbox
    messages are produced by the Layer 1 protocol and are encoded using the
    {!serialize} function, before being added to a smart-contract rollup's inbox.

    They are part of the [Rollup Management Protocol] that defines the
    communication protocol for exchanging messages between Layer 1 and Layer 2
    for a smart-contract rollup.

    There are two types of inbox messages: external and internal.

     Internal messages originate from Layer 1 smart-contract and consist of:
     - [payload] the parameters passed to the smart-contract rollup.
     - [sender] the Layer 1 contract caller.
     - [source] the public key hash used for originating the transaction.

    External messages originate from the [Sc_rollup_add_messages]
    manager-operation and consists of strings. The Layer 2 node is responsible
    for decoding and interpreting these messages.
