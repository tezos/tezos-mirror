(** Storage management of slots for the data-availability layer.

    {1 Overview}

    This module is an interface for the slot storage for the layer 1.

    Depending on the current level of the context and the [attestation_lag] (a
    constant given by the context), the status of the slot may differ:

    - For every level in the interval [current_level; current_level +
    attestation_lag - 1] the slot is [Pending]. This means a slot header was
    proposed but was not declared available yet.

    - For every level above [current_level + attestation_lag], the slot may be
    [attested]. For any slot attested by the protocol (i.e. indices returned by
    [finalize_pending_slots]), subscribers of the DAL should take into account
    the corresponding slots.

    - For every level below [current_level - attestation_lag], there should not be
   any slot in the storage.  *)

(** [find_slot_headers ctxt level] returns [Some slot_headers] where [slot_headers]
   are pending slots at level [level].  [None] is returned if no
   [slot_header] was registered at this level. The function fails if
   the reading into the context fails. *)
val find_slot_headers :
  Raw_context.t ->
  Raw_level_repr.t ->
  Dal_slot_repr.Header.t list option tzresult Lwt.t

(** [finalize_current_slot_headers ctxt] finalizes the current slot
   headers posted on this block and marks them as pending into the
   context.  *)
val finalize_current_slot_headers : Raw_context.t -> Raw_context.t Lwt.t

(** [finalize_pending_slot_headers ctxt ~number_of_slots] finalizes pending slot
    headers which are old enough (i.e. registered at level [current_level -
    attestation_lag]). All slots marked as available are returned. All the
    pending slots at [current_level - attestation_lag] level are removed from
    the context. *)
val finalize_pending_slot_headers :
  Raw_context.t ->
  number_of_slots:int ->
  (Raw_context.t * Dal_attestation_repr.t) tzresult Lwt.t

(** [get_slot_headers_history ctxt] returns the current value of slots_history stored
   in [ctxt], or Slots_history.genesis if no value is stored yet. *)
val get_slot_headers_history :
  Raw_context.t -> Dal_slot_repr.History.t tzresult Lwt.t

(** [compute_attested_slot_headers ~is_slot_attested published_slot_headers]
    filter the given [published_slot_headers] and return the list of attested
    slot headers and the corresponding bitset. *)
val compute_attested_slot_headers :
  is_slot_attested:(Dal_slot_repr.Header.t -> bool) ->
  Dal_slot_repr.Header.t list ->
  Dal_slot_repr.Header.t list * Dal_attestation_repr.t
