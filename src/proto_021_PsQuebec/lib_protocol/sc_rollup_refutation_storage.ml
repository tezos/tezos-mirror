    Two important notes:

    FIXME: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/4477
    As it should be used only via an RPC (and by the rollup-node), we should

    The game is created with [player] as the first player to
    move. The initial state of the game will be obtained from the
    commitment pair belonging to [opponent] at the conflict point. See
    [Sc_rollup_game_repr.initial] for documentation on how a pair of
    commitments is turned into an initial game state.

    This also deals with the other bits of data in the storage around
    the game. Notice that a staker can participate in multiple games in
    parallel. However, there is at most one game between two given stakers
    since a staker can publish at most one commitment per inbox level.

    It also initialises the timeout level to the current level plus
    [timeout_period_in_blocks] to mark the block level at which it becomes
    possible for anyone to end the game by timeout.
