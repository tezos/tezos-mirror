   This may be a bit heavy in practice. We could also assume that in
   practice, many bits in this bitfield will be set to one. Hence, we
   could consider a better encoding which is smaller in the optimistic
   case. For example:

   1. When all the slots are attested, the encoding can be represented
   in one bit.

   2. Otherwise, we can pack slots by [8]. Have a header of [slots/8]
   which is [1] if all the slots in this set are [1], [0]
   otherwise. For all pack with a bit set to [0], we give the explicit
   representation. Hence, if there are [256] slots, and [2] are not
   attested, this representation will be of size [32] bits + [16] bits
   = [48] bits which is better than [256] bits. *)
