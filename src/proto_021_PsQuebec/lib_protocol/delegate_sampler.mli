   slots.
   The selection of delegates is done by {i sampling} from a particular
   distribution of the stake among the active delegates.

   This module is responsible for maintaining the table
   {!Storage.Delegate_sampler_state}. *)

   function to predict an approximation of long term future slot
   allocations. It shouldn't be used in the baker. *)
