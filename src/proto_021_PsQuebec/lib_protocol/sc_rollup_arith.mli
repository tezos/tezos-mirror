(** This module provides a temporary toy rollup to be used as a demo. *)

(**

   This rollup is a stack machine equipped with addition.

   It processes postfix arithmetic expressions written as sequence of
   (space separated) [int] and [+] using the following rules:

   - a number [x] is interpreted as pushing [x] on the stack ;

   - a variable [a] is interpreted as storing the topmost element of the
     stack in the storage under the name "a" ;

   - a variable [out] is interpreted as adding a message to the outbox
     containing a single transaction batch with the topmost element of the
     stack as payload, the zero contract as destination, and a default
     entrypoint ;

   - a symbol [+] pops two integers [x] and [y] and pushes [x + y] on
     the stack ;

   - an input [hash:<HASH>] is interpreted as a directive to request the DAC
     data whose hash is <HASH> ;

   - an input [dal:<num_slots>:<e>:<num_p>:<s1>:<s2>:...:<sn>] is interpreted as a directive
   to provide the DAL parameters to the PVM, where:
     - <num_slots> is the number of slots
     - <e> is the attestation lag;
     - <num_p> is the number of pages;
     - each <si> is a slot to which the PVM subscribes to for [current level -
     attestation_lag - 1].

    DAL parameters can be set at most once. At each Start_of_level of some level
    [L] inbox message and if DAL is enabled for the rollup (via the directive
    above), the PVM will request the pages of the slots it is subscribed to. The
    (attested) slots that are actually fetched at level [L] are those published
    at level [L - e - 1]. Note that providing some DAC data via a DAL page will
    prevent from fetching the subsequent DAL pages.

   If a message is not syntactically correct or does not evaluate
   correctly, the machine stops its evaluation and waits for the next
   message.

   The machine has a boot sector which is a mere string used a prefix
   for each message.

   The module implements the {!Sc_rollup_PVM_sig.S}ÃŽ interface to be
   used in the smart contract rollup infrastructure.

   The machine exposes extra operations to be used in the rollup node.

    | Parsing
    | Evaluating

      message is syntactically correct, [Some false] when it
      contains a syntax error, and [None] when the machine is
      not in parsing state. *)

      Returns [None] if [x] does not exist. *)
  val get_var : state -> string -> int option Lwt.t

  (** [get_evaluation_result state] returns [Some true] if the current
      message evaluation succeeds, [Some false] if it failed, and
      [None] if the evaluation has not been done yet. *)

  (** [get_is_stuck state] returns [Some err] if some internal error
      made the machine fail during the last evaluation step. [None]
      if no internal error occurred. When a machine is stuck, it
      reboots, waiting for the next message to process. *)
