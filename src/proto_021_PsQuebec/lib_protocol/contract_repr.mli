(** This module defines identifiers for two basic types of contracts. It also
    specifies how to compute originated contract's hash from origination
    nonce. *)

(** A contract is simply an account on the blockchain ledger. There are two
    types of contracts:
    - implicit contracts represent accounts of users of the blockchain;
    hence, they are commonly called "user accounts" in the documentation;
    - originated are special accounts with a Michelson script attached to
    them. Every time a transaction is sent to an originated account, its
    associated script is run in order to trigger some action in response.
    These scripted accounts are commonly called "smart contracts" in the
    documentation.

    An implicit account is identified by the hash of the public key which was
    used to create it. The owner of the corresponding private key is the
    holder of the account. An originated contract's hash is derived from its
    origination nonce (see below). *)

    returned list is empty *)

    use it. This allows the latter to be compatible with {!encoding}, which
    is of key importance for backward compatibility reasons. *)
