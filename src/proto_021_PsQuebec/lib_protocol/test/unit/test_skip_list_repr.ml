(*

   In this test, we check that [best_basis] should be used to optimize
   the size of Merkel proofs based on skip lists. In such a context,
   the skip lists are referenced by Blake2B hashes (32 bytes-long) and
   their contents are also Blake2B hashes. Besides, a Merkel proof is
   a list of cells.

   To that end, we consider a deterministic sample of pairs [(n,
   target)] when [n] is the length of the skip list and [target] is
   the index of a cell in the skip list. Then, for each basis in [2
   .. max_basis] distinct from [best_basis], we check that the largest
   proof is larger than the largest proof of [best_basis].

     Basis [4] is very close to [3] as the best basis... therefore, we
     use a fixed seed for the random number generator to avoid any
     flakiness in the test.

  let best_basis = 4 in

  (*

     For the CI, we use relatively small values to avoid slowdowns.

     We choose [max_length] to be of the same order of magnitude as
     the longest lists we can meet in practice in the smart rollups
     inboxes.

     The real [max_length] can be found in [constants_repr.ml]. At the time
     of writing this message, the value is [1_000_000].
