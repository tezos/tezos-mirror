(** Extends the {!Lwt_result_syntax} with additional utilities for wrapping
    results produced by the protocol, i.e. [Environment.Error_monad.tzresult],
    to [tzresult Lwt.t] values used in the tests.

    The added utilities are binding operators. They use the same symbols as
    the ones from {!Lwt_result_syntax} with an added [@] character. This
    character symbolizes the {!e wrapping} of the internal error monad type in a
    shell error.  *)
