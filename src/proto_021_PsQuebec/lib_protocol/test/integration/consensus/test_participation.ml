  - a delegate that participates enough, gets its attesting rewards at the end of the cycle,
  - a delegate that does not participating enough during a cycle, doesn't get rewarded.

  The case distinction is made by the boolean argument [sufficient_participation].
  If [sufficient_participation] is true,
  then a validator attests for as long as the minimal required activity is not reached,
  otherwise it does not attest.
  Finally, we check the validator's balance at the end of the cycle.
