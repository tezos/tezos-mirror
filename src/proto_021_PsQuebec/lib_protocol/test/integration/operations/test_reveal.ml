   We imitate the behaviour of

   https://tzkt.io/ooSocfx3xxzDo7eFyGu6ZDR1svzMrbaJtBikQanXXhwrqMuWfGz

   which provides evidence of a failing reveal with a gas exhaustion
   error due to an incorrect gas limit of 0, which still takes effect
   as witnessed by the subsequent (reveal-less) transfer

   https://tzkt.io/opBQQJQ5senPP5v8PfPFf4uVQqKRE5RVjbwx8uD4SqeRs2JGcVw

   This showcases a bad separation of concerns between pre-checking
   and the application of manager operations per-se within
   [Protocol.Apply.apply_operation]. The situation originated because
   [precheck_manager_contents_lists] would reveal the manager by
   calling [Protocol.Alpha_context.Contract.reveal_manager_key] before
   [prepare_apply_manager_operation_content] has consumed the declared
   gas.

   With !5182 we have fixed this situation by revealing the manager
   contract at application time. The following test isolates the
   failing reveal and asserts that the manager is not revealed after
   the failing op.

   As of !5506, the reveal operation does not pass precheck
   anyway. Unfortunately, this means that this test has lost some of
   its original purpose. Fortunately, {!test_empty_account_on_reveal}
   offers a similar scenario to what this test was supposed to do: a
   reveal fails during application and we check that the contract is
   not revealed afterward. *)

(* Fix #2774

   We test that reveals can only succeed if they are placed at the
   first position in a batch of manager operations, and that moreover
   reveal operations occur uniquely in batches.

   - First, [test_reveal_incorrect_position_in_batch] asserts that a
   [[transfer; reveal]] batch where a valid reveal follows another
   valid op (different from a reveal, so here a transfer) fails with
   an [Apply.Incorrect_reveal_position] error.

   - Second, we test a batch consisting of duplicate (potentially)
   valid reveal operations. We assert the second reveal to fail again
   with an [Apply.Incorrect_reveal_position] error, and for the first
   reveal to be backtracked.

   - Then, we test batches with duplicate reveals which follow a
   failing one and we assert again the second reveal fails skipped. We
   do this for the 3 different reasons a well-placed reveal might fail
   (as tested above): gas exhaustion, insolvency, and emptying the
   balance while revealing.
