    Subject:      The Failing_noop operation was added bearing in mind the
                  possibility for the end user to sign arbitrary bytes,
                  encapsulate in the operation, with the absolute garanty that
                  the signed bytes can't be used for something against the
                  user's will. The Failing_noop operation always fails when
                  applied.
