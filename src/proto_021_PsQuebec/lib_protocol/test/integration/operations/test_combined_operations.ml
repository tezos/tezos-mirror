    Component:  Protocol (combined operations)
    Invocation: dune exec src/proto_021_PsquebeC/lib_protocol/test/integration/operations/main.exe \
                  -- --file test_combined_operations.ml

    Subject:    Multiple manager operations can be grouped in one
                batch, ensuring their ordered and atomic application
                (that is, either they all succeed, or none of them is
                applied).

                More precisely, if any operation in the batch fails at
                application time, then the previously applied
                operations are backtracked, leaving the context
                unchanged, and the remaining operations are
                skipped. However, note that the fees for the batch are
                collected by the baker regardless of the success or
                failure of the application of the batch.

                All manager operations in a batch must have the same
                source.

                There may be overlap with
                [lib_protocol/test/integration/validate/test_validation_batch.ml].
