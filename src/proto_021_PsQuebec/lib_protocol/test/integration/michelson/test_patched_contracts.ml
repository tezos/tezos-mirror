(** This functor provides testing for legacy script patches. Patches to
    be tested should be placed in a module conformal to the signature
    [LEGACY_SCRIPT_PATCHES]. It should contain a list of patches and for
    each patch it has to provide a hash of the patched contract and the
    new code (as binary-encoded Micheline).

    Additionally for each patch 3 files need to be placed in
    [patched_contracts] subdirectory:
    * script_hash.original.tz â€“ containing the original version of the
      script;
    * script_hash.patched.tz - containing the patched version;
    * script_hash.diff - containing the diff between the two.

    These files are there so that reviewers of the migration can easily
    see what changes are made to each contract and these tests make sure
    that the patched code supplied in file is identical to the one
    included in the migration; and that the diff is correct. *)
