   the setup [state] or perform operations in the setup blocks or both
   that have to be performed according to a [cycle_index].

   - [opt_prelude] is an optional prelude.

   - [candidates_generator] generates operations of the descriptor
   [op_kind] according to the information in [state] that are valid
   upon [state.block]. *)
