(** A refutation game proof is required as part of the final move in a
    game.

    This proof is basically a combination of a PVM proof (provided by
    each implementation of the PVM signature) and an input proof. To
    check the proof we must check each part separately and then also
    check that they match on the two points where they touch:

      - the [input_requested] of the PVM proof should match the starting
      point of the input proof ;

      - the [input_given] of the PVM proof should match the output
      message of the input proof.

    It is also often the case that the PVM proof has [No_input_required]
    for its [input_requested] and [None] for its [input_given]. If this
    is the case, we don't need the input proof at all and the [input_proof]
    parameter in our proof should be [None]. *)

(** The proof that a reveal is valid. *)
type reveal_proof =
  | Raw_data_proof of string
      (** The existence of reveal for a given hash when the
          [input_requested] is the [Needs_reveal Reveal_raw_data]. *)
  | Metadata_proof
  | Dal_page_proof of {
      page_id : Dal_slot_repr.Page.t;
      proof : Dal_slot_repr.History.proof;
    }
      (** The existence or not of a confirmed slot for a given page ID when the
          [input_requested] is the [Needs_reveal Request_dal_page]. *)
  | Dal_parameters_proof
      (** Proof for revealing DAL parameters that were used for the slots
          published at [published_level]. The [published_level] parameter
          enables the kernel to retrieve historical DAL parameters,
          eliminating the need for each kernel to store past DAL parameters. *)

(** A PVM proof [pvm_step] is combined with an [input_proof] to provide
    the proof necessary to validate a single step in the refutation
    game.

    If the step doesn't involve any input, [proof_input_requested
    pvm_step] and [proof_input_given pvm_step] will be
    [No_input_required] and [None] respectively, and in this case
    [inbox] should also be [None].

    In the case that input is involved, [input_proof] is either:

    - a proof of the next inbox message available from the inbox
      after a given location; this must match up with [pvm_step]
      to give a valid refutation proof ; or

    - a proof of a reveal satisfiability.

    - a claim that the input involved is the first input of the inbox, which
      does not need to be proved as we know by construction what is
      the input (i.e. the [Start_of_level] of the level after the rollup's
      origination level).

        PVM kind.
