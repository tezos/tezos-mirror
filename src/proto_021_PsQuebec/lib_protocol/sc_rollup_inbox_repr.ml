(**

   A Merkelized inbox represents a list of messages. This list
   is decomposed into sublists of messages, one for each Tezos level greater
   than the level where SCORU is activated.

   This module is designed to:

   1. provide a space-efficient representation for proofs of inbox
      inclusions (only for inboxes obtained at the end of block
      validation) ;

   2. offer an efficient function to add a new batch of messages in the
      inbox at the current level.

   To solve (1), we use a proof tree H which is implemented by a merkelized skip
   list allowing for compact inclusion proofs (See {!skip_list_repr.ml}).

   To solve (2), we maintain a separate proof tree C witnessing the contents of
   messages of the current level also implemented by a merkelized skip list for
   the same reason.

   The protocol maintains the hashes of the head of H and C.

   The rollup node needs to maintain a full representation for C and a
   partial representation for H back to the level of the LCC.
