(* TODO: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/7070

   Rework the interface of dal_pages_request.mli (see the issue for details). *)

(** Access DAL slots and pages content.

    This module is a wrapper on top of {!Store.Dal_slot_pages} module to
    access DAL slots and pages' data that have been previously fetched by
    the rollup node.
*)

(** This error is returned when a slot, identified by its ID, is not found in
    the store. *)
type error += Dal_slot_not_found_in_store of Dal.Slot.Header.id

(** Retrieve the pages' content of the given slot ID's from the store.

    The function returns [Dal_slot_not_found_in_store] if no entry is found in
    the store for the given ID (i.e. no page is registered with or without content).

    If the returned value is [Some pages], the slot whose ID is given is
    supposed to be confirmed and [pages] correspond to the pages of the slot.
    Otherwise [None] is returned.

    The function relies on {!Store.Dal_slot_pages}'s invariants to guarantee that:
    - the pages are returned in increasing order w.r.t. their indexes in the slot;
    - the size of the list, in case it is not empty, is equal to the expected
      number of pages in a slot.

    [dal_attestation_lag] is used to retrieve the correct entry in [store].

    The function returns [Dal_slot_not_found_in_store] if no entry is found in
    the store for the given ID. It returns [None] in case the level of the
    requested page is out of bounds (e.g. in the future). Said otherwise,

    which the content has already been downloaded and saved to the store.
