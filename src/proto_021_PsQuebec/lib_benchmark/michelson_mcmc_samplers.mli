(** [Make_code_sampler] produces a sampler for well-typed Michelson code.
    The parameters of the functor are:
    - a module [Michelson_base] implementing samplers for basic values
    - a module [Crypto_samplers] implementing samplers for pk/pkh/sk triplets
    - a module [X] containing some parameters to the Markov chain sampler:
      - [rng_state] is the mutable state that will be used during sampling
      - [target_size] specifies the size, in terms of Micheline nodes, of the
        terms that the sampler should try to produce
      - [verbosity] specifies how much information should be written on stdout
        during the sampling process.

    The outcome is a [michelson_code] [generator]. The [burn_in] parameter
    specifies how much samples should be thrown away before starting to
    produce sample (this is used to let the underlying Markov chain reach
    its stationary distribution - the value should be commensurate with
    the [target_size].
