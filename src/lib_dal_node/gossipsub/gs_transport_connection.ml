(** This module implements a cache of alternative peers (aka PX peers), that is,
    peers we are not (yet) connected to, advertised by P2P neighbors within
    Prune messages.

    The cache associates a P2P point to each pair made of the advertised peer
    and the peer that advertised it. In case of redundancy, the last advertised
    point is kept in the cache.

    The cache is in theory not bounded. However, some invariants on the way

    are not considered outgoing connections by default, as they are not trusted

    Indeed, Gossipsub tries to maintain a threshold of outbound connections per

    outbound to avoid possible love bombing attacks. The Rust version also
    implements a way to mitigate this risk, but not the Go implementation.

         - A legit pair [(point, peer)] is already known by P2P, but the remote
         peer is disconnected for some reason;

         is the expected peer id for this point;
         - The connection fails, but the old (correct) association [(point,
         peer)] is lost.

         We may want to revert [peer'] association to [point]. But we sill have
         an issue in case [(point, peer)] is actually the fake info and [(point,
         peer')] the legit association but the node is disconnected when trying
