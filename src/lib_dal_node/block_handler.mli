  the L1 crawler's [status] field in [node_context] is updated accordingly.

(** [new_finalized_head ctxt cctxt l1_crawler cryptobox block_hash shell_header
    ~launch_time] processes a new finalized L1 block. It performs cleanup of old
    DAL data, updates the committee cache, re-registers the gossipsub message
    validation hook, and triggers block-level processing (e.g. slot header
    storage, shard publishing to Gossipsub, attestation analysis). This function
    is expected to be called for every finalized head. *)
