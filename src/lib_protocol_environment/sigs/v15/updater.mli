      [op1] and [op2] are valid in the same context.

      [compare_operations (oph1,op1) (oph2,op2) = 0] happens only if
      [Operation_hash.compare oph1 oph2 = 0], meaning [op1 = op2] only
      when [op1] and [op2] are structurally identical.

      Two operations of different validation_passes are compared in the
      reverse order of their [validation_pass]: the one with the
      smaller [validation_pass] is compared as being the greater.

      When belonging to the same validation_pass, two operations
      comparison depends on their static parameters. An abstract weight
      is computed for each operation based on its static parameters.

  (** {2 Block (and operation) validation and application}

      The following functions may be used when an existing block is
      received through the network, when a new block is created, or
      when operations are considered on their own e.g. in a mempool or
      during an RPC call.

      Validation aims at deciding quickly whether a block or
      an operation is valid, with minimal computations and without
      writing anything in the storage. A block is valid if it can be
      applied without failure. An operation is valid if it can be
      safely included in a block without causing it to fail.

      The application of an operation updates the {!Context.t} with
      regards to its semantics (e.g. updating balances after a
      transaction). The application of a block updates the context
      with all its operations and some additional global
      effects. Isolated operations may be applied as part of an RPC
      call to simulate their effects.

      Blocks and operations must always be validated before they are
      applied. Indeed, the application assumes their validity as a
      precondition, meaning that the application of an invalid block
      might yield incorrect results instead of failing cleanly.

      Note that in protocol versions <= K, where the validation
      functions do not yet exist, the validation of existing blocks is
      done by trying to apply it using the [Partial_validation] mode
      below. Therefore, the application of a validated block may still
      fail in these protocols. *)

  (** The mode indicates the circumstances in which a block and/or
      operations are validated or applied, and contains specific
      information. It must be provided as an argument to
      [begin_validation] and [begin_application]. *)
  type mode =
    | Application of block_header
        (** Standard validation or application of a preexisting block. *)
    | Partial_validation of block_header
        (** Partial validation of a preexisting block. This mode is
            meant to quickly reject obviously invalid alternate
            branches by only performing a subset of checks.
            Therefore, application of blocks or operations makes no
            sense in this mode: calling [begin_application] with this
            mode returns an error. *)
    | Construction of {
        predecessor_hash : Block_hash.t;
        timestamp : Time.t;
        block_header_data : block_header_data;
      }
        (** Construction of a new block. The main difference with the
            previous modes is that we cannot provide the block header to the
            [begin_] functions, since the block does not exist yet. Note that
            the [begin_] functions may be called in this mode without knowing
            yet which operations will be included in the future block.

            The provided [block_header_data] is not expected to be the final
            value of the field of the same type in the {!type-block_header} of
            the constructed block. Instead, it should be a protocol-specific,
            good enough, "prototype" of the final value. E.g. if the
            {!block_header_data} type for the current economic protocol includes
            a signature, then the provided [block_header_data] should contain a
            fake signature (since providing a correct signature is not possible
            at this stage). *)

        predecessor_hash : Block_hash.t;

            suited for this) or by some RPCs
            e.g. [preapply/operations]. Calling the [finalize_] functions makes
            no sense in this mode. *)

      of a block (or during the lifetime of a mempool or RPC). It is

      This state is immutable thus validator or baker implementations
      are allowed to pause, replay or backtrack throughout validation
      steps. *)

  (** Similar to {!validation_state}, but for the application process. *)
  type application_state

  (** [begin_validation predecessor_context chain_id mode
      ~predecessor] initializes the {!validation_state} for the
      validation process of an existing or new block.

      [predecessor_context] and [predecessor] are the resulting
      context and shell header of the predecessor block. Exceptionally
      in {!Partial_validation} mode, they may instead come from any
      ancestor block that is more recent (i.e. has a greater level)
      than the current head's "last_finalized_block_level".

      [mode] specifies the circumstances of validation and also
      carries additional information: see {!mode}.

      Note that for protocol versions <= K where [begin_validation]
      does not exist yet, this calls the old [begin_application] by
      necessity. However, in [Application] mode, this calls the old
      [begin_application] in [Partial_validation] mode in order to run
      more quickly. This preserves the behavior of [precheck] in
      [lib_validation/block_validation.ml] for old protocols. It does
      mean that the application of a validated block may fail in these
      protocols. *)
