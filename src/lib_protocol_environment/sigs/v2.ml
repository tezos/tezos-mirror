type ('a,'b) result = Ok of 'a | Error of 'b

(** {1 Operations on format strings} *)

(** Format strings are character strings with special lexical conventions
  that defines the functionality of formatted input/output functions. Format
  strings are used to read data with formatted input functions from module
  {!Scanf} and to print data with formatted output functions from modules
  {!Printf} and {!Format}.

  Format strings are made of three kinds of entities:
  - {e conversions specifications}, introduced by the special character ['%']
    followed by one or more characters specifying what kind of argument to
    read or print,
  - {e formatting indications}, introduced by the special character ['@']
    followed by one or more characters specifying how to read or print the
    argument,
  - {e plain characters} that are regular characters with usual lexical
    conventions. Plain characters specify string literals to be read in the
    input or printed in the output.

  There is an additional lexical rule to escape the special characters ['%']
  and ['@'] in format strings: if a special character follows a ['%']
  character, it is treated as a plain character. In other words, ["%%"] is
  considered as a plain ['%'] and ["%@"] as a plain ['@'].

  For more information about conversion specifications and formatting
  indications available, read the documentation of modules {!Scanf},
  {!Printf} and {!Format}.
*)

(** Format strings have a general and highly polymorphic type
    [('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f) format6].
    The two simplified types, [format] and [format4] below are
    included for backward compatibility with earlier releases of
    OCaml.

    The meaning of format string type parameters is as follows:

    - ['a] is the type of the parameters of the format for formatted output
      functions ([printf]-style functions);
      ['a] is the type of the values read by the format for formatted input
      functions ([scanf]-style functions).

    - ['b] is the type of input source for formatted input functions and the
      type of output target for formatted output functions.
      For [printf]-style functions from module {!Printf}, ['b] is typically
      [out_channel];
      for [printf]-style functions from module {!Format}, ['b] is typically
      {!Format.formatter};
      for [scanf]-style functions from module {!Scanf}, ['b] is typically
      {!Scanf.Scanning.in_channel}.

      Type argument ['b] is also the type of the first argument given to
      user's defined printing functions for [%a] and [%t] conversions,
      and user's defined reading functions for [%r] conversion.

    - ['c] is the type of the result of the [%a] and [%t] printing
      functions, and also the type of the argument transmitted to the
      first argument of [kprintf]-style functions or to the
      [kscanf]-style functions.

    - ['d] is the type of parameters for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['e] is the type of the receiver function for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['f] is the final result type of a formatted input/output function
      invocation: for the [printf]-style functions, it is typically [unit];
      for the [scanf]-style functions, it is typically the result type of the
      receiver function.

    literal [s].

    literal. If you need this functionality, use the more general
    {!Scanf.format_from_string} function.

(** [f1 ^^ f2] catenates format strings [f1] and [f2]. The result is a
  format string that behaves as the concatenation of format strings [f1] and
  [f2]: in case of formatted output, it accepts arguments from [f1], then
  arguments from [f2]; in case of formatted input, it returns results from
  [f1], then results from [f2].

(** List operations.

   Some functions are flagged as not tail-recursive.  A tail-recursive
   function uses constant stack space, while a non-tail-recursive function
   uses stack space proportional to the length of its list argument, which
   can be a problem with very long lists.  When the function takes several
   list arguments, an approximate formula giving stack usage (in some
   unspecified constant unit) is shown in parentheses.

   The above considerations can usually be ignored if your lists are not

(** String operations.

  A string is an immutable data structure that contains a
  fixed-length sequence of (single-byte) characters. Each character
  can be accessed in constant time through its index.

  Given a string [s] of length [l], we can access each of the [l]
  characters of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
  [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
  range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
  characters or at the beginning or end of the string.  We call a
  position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
  (inclusive). Note that the character at index [n] is between
  positions [n] and [n+1].

  Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
  substring of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are
  valid positions in [s].

  Note: OCaml strings used to be modifiable in place, for instance via
  the {!String.set} and {!String.blit} functions described below. This
  usage is only possible when the compiler is put in "unsafe-string"
  mode by giving the [-unsafe-string] command-line option. This
  compatibility mode makes the types [string] and [bytes] (see module
  {!Bytes}) interchangeable so that functions expecting byte sequences
  can also accept strings as arguments and modify them.

  The distinction between [bytes] and [string] was introduced in OCaml
  4.02, and the "unsafe-string" compatibility mode was the default
  until OCaml 4.05. Starting with 4.06, the compatibility mode is
  opt-in; we intend to remove the option in the future.

(** Byte sequence operations.

   A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a
   fixed-length sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in
   constant time for reading or writing.

   Given a byte sequence [s] of length [l], we can access each of the
   [l] bytes of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
   [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
   range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
   bytes or at the beginning or end of the sequence.  We call a
   position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
   (inclusive). Note that the byte at index [n] is between positions
   [n] and [n+1].

   Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
   range of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are valid
   positions in [s].

   Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the [set]
   and [blit] functions described below.  See also strings (module
   {!String}), which are almost the same data structure, but cannot be
   modified in place.

   Bytes are represented by the OCaml type [char].

(** 32-bit integers.

   This module provides operations on the type [int32]
   of signed 32-bit integers.  Unlike the built-in [int] type,

(** Pretty-printing.

   This module implements a pretty-printing facility to format values
   within {{!boxes}'pretty-printing boxes'} and {{!tags}'semantic tags'}
   combined with a set of {{!fpp}printf-like functions}.
   The pretty-printer splits lines at specified {{!breaks}break hints},
   and indents lines according to the box structure.
   Similarly, {{!tags}semantic tags} can be used to decouple text
   presentation from its contents.

   This pretty-printing facility is implemented as an overlay on top of
   abstract {{!section:formatter}formatters} which provide basic output
   functions.
   Some formatters are predefined, notably:
   - {!std_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stdout}stdout}
   - {!err_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stderr}stderr}

   Most functions in the {!Format} module come in two variants:
   a short version that operates on {!std_formatter} and the
   generic version prefixed by [pp_] that takes a formatter
   as its first argument.

   More formatters can be created with {!formatter_of_out_channel},
   {!formatter_of_buffer}, {!formatter_of_symbolic_output_buffer}
   or using {{!section:formatter}custom formatters}.

*)

(** {1 Introduction}
   For a gentle introduction to the basics of pretty-printing using
   [Format], read
   {{:http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}
    http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}.

   You may consider this module as providing an extension to the
   [printf] facility to provide automatic line splitting. The addition of
   pretty-printing annotations to your regular [printf] format strings gives
   you fancy indentation and line breaks.
   Pretty-printing annotations are described below in the documentation of
   the function {!Format.fprintf}.

   You may also use the explicit pretty-printing box management and printing
   functions provided by this module. This style is more basic but more
   verbose than the concise [fprintf] format strings.

   For instance, the sequence
   [open_box 0; print_string "x ="; print_space ();
    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()]
   that prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing box, can be
   abbreviated as [printf "@[%s@ %i@]@." "x =" 1], or even shorter
   [printf "@[x =@ %i@]@." 1].

   Rule of thumb for casual users of this library:
 - use simple pretty-printing boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);
 - use simple break hints as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a
   simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that outputs a space
   indicating a break hint;
 - once a pretty-printing box is open, display its material with basic
   printing functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);
 - when the material for a pretty-printing box has been printed, call
   [close_box ()] to close the box;
 - at the end of pretty-printing, flush the pretty-printer to display all
   the remaining material, e.g. evaluate [print_newline ()].

   The behavior of pretty-printing commands is unspecified
   if there is no open pretty-printing box. Each box opened by
   one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]
   for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the
   boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly.

   In case of interactive use, each phrase is executed in the initial state
   of the standard pretty-printer: after each phrase execution, the
   interactive system closes all open pretty-printing boxes, flushes all
   pending text, and resets the standard pretty-printer.

   Warning: mixing calls to pretty-printing functions of this module with
   calls to {!Stdlib} low level output functions is error prone.

   The pretty-printing functions output material that is delayed in the
   pretty-printer queue and stacks in order to compute proper line
   splitting. In contrast, basic I/O output functions write directly in
   their output device. As a consequence, the output of a basic I/O function
   may appear before the output of a pretty-printing function that has been
   called before. For instance,
   [
    Stdlib.print_string "<";
    Format.print_string "PRETTY";
    Stdlib.print_string ">";
    Format.print_string "TEXT";
   ]
   leads to output [<>PRETTYTEXT].

type formatter
(** Abstract data corresponding to a pretty-printer (also called a
    formatter) and all its machinery. See also {!section:formatter}. *)

(** {1:boxes Pretty-printing boxes} *)

(** The pretty-printing engine uses the concepts of pretty-printing box and
  break hint to drive indentation and line splitting behavior of the
  pretty-printer.

  Each different pretty-printing box kind introduces a specific line splitting
  policy:

  - within an {e horizontal} box, break hints never split the line (but the
    line may be split in a box nested deeper),
  - within a {e vertical} box, break hints always split the line,
  - within an {e horizontal/vertical} box, if the box fits on the current line
    then break hints never split the line, otherwise break hint always split
    the line,
  - within a {e compacting} box, a break hint never splits the line,
    unless there is no more room on the current line.

  Note that line splitting policy is box specific: the policy of a box does
  not rule the policy of inner boxes. For instance, if a vertical box is
  nested in an horizontal box, all break hints within the vertical box will
  split the line.
*)

val pp_open_box : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_box ppf d] opens a new compacting pretty-printing box with
    offset [d] in the formatter [ppf].

   Within this box, the pretty-printer prints as much as possible material on
   every line.

   A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
   print the remainder of the box.

   Within this box, the pretty-printer emphasizes the box structure: a break
   hint also splits the line if the splitting ``moves to the left''
   (i.e. the new line gets an indentation smaller than the one of the current
   line).

   This box is the general purpose pretty-printing box.

   If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, offset [d] is added to
   the current indentation.
*)


val pp_close_box : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Closes the most recently open pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_open_hbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [pp_open_hbox ppf ()] opens a new 'horizontal' pretty-printing box.

  This box prints material on a single line.

  Break hints in a horizontal box never split the line.
  (Line splitting may still occur inside boxes nested deeper).
*)

val pp_open_vbox : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_vbox ppf d] opens a new 'vertical' pretty-printing box
  with offset [d].

  This box prints material on as many lines as break hints in the box.

  Every break hint in a vertical box splits the line.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

val pp_open_hvbox : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_hvbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box
  with offset [d].

  This box behaves as an horizontal box if it fits on a single line,
  otherwise it behaves as a vertical box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

val pp_open_hovbox : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_hovbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal-or-vertical'
  pretty-printing box with offset [d].

  This box prints material as much as possible on every line.

  A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
  print the remainder of the box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

(** {1 Formatting functions} *)

val pp_print_string : formatter -> string -> unit
(** [pp_print_string ppf s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_as : formatter -> int -> string -> unit
(** [pp_print_as ppf len s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box.
  The pretty-printer formats [s] as if it were of length [len].
*)

val pp_print_int : formatter -> int -> unit
(** Print an integer in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_char : formatter -> char -> unit
(** Print a character in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_bool : formatter -> bool -> unit
(** Print a boolean in the current pretty-printing box. *)

(** {1:breaks Break hints} *)

(** A 'break hint' tells the pretty-printer to output some space or split the
  line whichever way is more appropriate to the current pretty-printing box
  splitting rules.

  Break hints are used to separate printing items and are mandatory to let
  the pretty-printer correctly split lines and indent items.

  Simple break hints are:
  - the 'space': output a space or split the line if appropriate,
  - the 'cut': split the line if appropriate.

  Note: the notions of space and line splitting are abstract for the
  pretty-printing engine, since those notions can be completely redefined
  by the programmer.
  However, in the pretty-printer default setting, ``output a space'' simply
  means printing a space character (ASCII code 32) and ``split the line''
  means printing a newline character (ASCII code 10).
*)

val pp_print_space : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [pp_print_space ppf ()] emits a 'space' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints one space.

  [pp_print_space ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 1 0].
*)

val pp_print_cut : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [pp_print_cut ppf ()] emits a 'cut' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints nothing.

  [pp_print_cut ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 0 0].
*)

val pp_print_break : formatter -> int -> int -> unit
(** [pp_print_break ppf nspaces offset] emits a 'full' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints [nspaces] spaces.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
  the current indentation.
*)

val pp_print_custom_break :
  formatter ->
  fits:(string * int * string) ->
  breaks:(string * int * string) ->
  unit
(** [pp_print_custom_break ppf ~fits:(s1, n, s2) ~breaks:(s3, m, s4)] emits a
   custom break hint: the pretty-printer may split the line at this point.

   If it does not split the line, then the [s1] is emitted, then [n] spaces,
   then [s2].

   If it splits the line, then it emits the [s3] string, then an indent
   (according to the box rules), then an offset of [m] spaces, then the [s4]
   string.

   While [n] and [m] are handled by [formatter_out_functions.out_indent], the
   strings will be handled by [formatter_out_functions.out_string]. This allows
   for a custom formatter that handles indentation distinctly, for example,
   outputs [<br/>] tags or [&nbsp;] entities.

   The custom break is useful if you want to change which visible
   (non-whitespace) characters are printed in case of break or no break. For
   example, when printing a list [ [a; b; c] ], you might want to add a
   trailing semicolon when it is printed vertically:

   {[
[
  a;
  b;
  c;
]
   ]}

   You can do this as follows:
   {[
printf "@[<v 0>[@;<0 2>@[<v 0>a;@,b;@,c@]%t]@]@\n"
  (pp_print_custom_break ~fits:("", 0, "") ~breaks:(";", 0, ""))
   ]}

  @since 4.08.0
*)

val pp_force_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Force a new line in the current pretty-printing box.

  The pretty-printer must split the line at this point,

  Not the normal way of pretty-printing, since imperative line splitting may
  interfere with current line counters and box size calculation.
  Using break hints within an enclosing vertical box is a better
  alternative.
*)

val pp_print_if_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Execute the next formatting command if the preceding line
  has just been split. Otherwise, ignore the next formatting
  command.
*)

(** {1 Pretty-printing termination} *)

val pp_print_flush : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

  All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.
  In addition, the pretty-printer low level output device is flushed to
  ensure that all pending text is really displayed.

  Note: never use [print_flush] in the normal course of a pretty-printing
  routine, since the pretty-printer uses a complex buffering machinery to
  properly indent the output; manually flushing those buffers at random
  would conflict with the pretty-printer strategy and result to poor
  rendering.

  Only consider using [print_flush] when displaying all pending material is
  mandatory (for instance in case of interactive use when you want the user
  to read some text) and when resetting the pretty-printer state will not
  disturb further pretty-printing.

  Warning: If the output device of the pretty-printer is an output channel,
  repeated calls to [print_flush] means repeated calls to {!Stdlib.flush}
  to flush the out channel; these explicit flush calls could foil the
  buffering strategy of output channels and could dramatically impact
  efficiency.
*)

val pp_print_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

  All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.

  Equivalent to {!print_flush} followed by a new line.
  See corresponding words of caution for {!print_flush}.

  Note: this is not the normal way to output a new line;
  the preferred method is using break hints within a vertical pretty-printing
  box.
*)

(** {1 Margin} *)

val pp_set_margin : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_set_margin ppf d] sets the right margin to [d] (in characters):
  the pretty-printer splits lines that overflow the right margin according to
  the break hints given.
  Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.
  If [d] is too large, the right margin is set to the maximum
  admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).
  If [d] is less than the current maximum indentation limit, the
  maximum indentation limit is decreased while trying to preserve
  a minimal ratio [max_indent/margin>=50%] and if possible
  the current difference [margin - max_indent].

  See also {!pp_set_geometry}.
*)

val pp_get_margin : formatter -> unit -> int
(** Returns the position of the right margin. *)

(** {1 Maximum indentation limit} *)

val pp_set_max_indent : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_set_max_indent ppf d] sets the maximum indentation limit of lines
  to [d] (in characters):
  once this limit is reached, new pretty-printing boxes are rejected to the
  left, unless the enclosing box fully fits on the current line.
  As an illustration,
  {[ set_margin 10; set_max_indent 5; printf "@[123456@[7@]89A@]@." ]}
  yields
  {[
    123456
    789A
  ]}
  because the nested box ["@[7@]"] is opened after the maximum indentation
  limit ([7>5]) and its parent box does not fit on the current line.
  Either decreasing the length of the parent box to make it fit on a line:
  {[ printf "@[123456@[7@]89@]@." ]}
  or opening an intermediary box before the maximum indentation limit which
  fits on the current line
  {[ printf "@[123@[456@[7@]89@]A@]@." ]}
  avoids the rejection to the left of the inner boxes and print respectively
  ["123456789"] and ["123456789A"] .
  Note also that vertical boxes never fit on a line whereas horizontal boxes
  always fully fit on the current line.

  Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.

  If [d] is too large, the limit is set to the maximum
  admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).

  If [d] is greater or equal than the current margin, it is ignored,
  and the current maximum indentation limit is kept.

  See also {!pp_set_geometry}.
*)

val pp_get_max_indent : formatter -> unit -> int
(** Return the maximum indentation limit (in characters). *)

(** {1 Maximum formatting depth} *)

(** The maximum formatting depth is the maximum number of pretty-printing
  boxes simultaneously open.

  Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an ellipsis (more
  precisely as the text returned by {!get_ellipsis_text} [()]).
*)

val pp_set_max_boxes : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_set_max_boxes ppf max] sets the maximum number of pretty-printing
    boxes simultaneously open.

  Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an ellipsis (more
  precisely as the text returned by {!get_ellipsis_text} [()]).

  Nothing happens if [max] is smaller than 2.
*)

val pp_get_max_boxes : formatter -> unit -> int
(** Returns the maximum number of pretty-printing boxes allowed before
  ellipsis.
*)

val pp_over_max_boxes : formatter -> unit -> bool
(** Tests if the maximum number of pretty-printing boxes allowed have already
  been opened.
*)

(** {1 Tabulation boxes} *)

(**

  A {e tabulation box} prints material on lines divided into cells of fixed
  length. A tabulation box provides a simple way to display vertical columns
  of left adjusted text.

  This box features command [set_tab] to define cell boundaries, and command
  [print_tab] to move from cell to cell and split the line when there is no
  more cells to print on the line.

  Note: printing within tabulation box is line directed, so arbitrary line
  splitting inside a tabulation box leads to poor rendering. Yet, controlled
  use of tabulation boxes allows simple printing of columns within
  module {!Format}.
*)

val pp_open_tbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [open_tbox ()] opens a new tabulation box.

  This box prints lines separated into cells of fixed width.

  Inside a tabulation box, special {e tabulation markers} defines points of
  interest on the line (for instance to delimit cell boundaries).
  Function {!Format.set_tab} sets a tabulation marker at insertion point.

  A tabulation box features specific {e tabulation breaks} to move to next
  tabulation marker or split the line. Function {!Format.print_tbreak} prints
  a tabulation break.
*)

val pp_close_tbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Closes the most recently opened tabulation box. *)

val pp_set_tab : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Sets a tabulation marker at current insertion point. *)

val pp_print_tab : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [print_tab ()] emits a 'next' tabulation break hint: if not already set on
  a tabulation marker, the insertion point moves to the first tabulation
  marker on the right, or the pretty-printer splits the line and insertion
  point moves to the leftmost tabulation marker.

  It is equivalent to [print_tbreak 0 0]. *)

val pp_print_tbreak : formatter -> int -> int -> unit
(** [print_tbreak nspaces offset] emits a 'full' tabulation break hint.

  If not already set on a tabulation marker, the insertion point moves to the
  first tabulation marker on the right and the pretty-printer prints
  [nspaces] spaces.

  If there is no next tabulation marker on the right, the pretty-printer
  splits the line at this point, then insertion point moves to the leftmost
  tabulation marker of the box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
  the current indentation.
*)

(** {1 Ellipsis} *)

val pp_set_ellipsis_text : formatter -> string -> unit
(** Set the text of the ellipsis printed when too many pretty-printing boxes
  are open (a single dot, [.], by default).
*)

val pp_get_ellipsis_text : formatter -> unit -> string
(** Return the text of the ellipsis. *)

(** {1 Convenience formatting functions.} *)

val pp_print_list:
  ?pp_sep:(formatter -> unit -> unit) ->

(** [pp_print_list ?pp_sep pp_v ppf l] prints items of list [l],
  using [pp_v] to print each item, and calling [pp_sep]
  between items ([pp_sep] defaults to {!pp_print_cut}.
  Does nothing on empty lists.

  @since 4.02.0

(** {1:fpp Formatted pretty-printing} *)

(**
  Module [Format] provides a complete set of [printf] like functions for
  pretty-printing using format string specifications.

  Specific annotations may be added in the format strings to give
  pretty-printing commands to the pretty-printing engine.

  Those annotations are introduced in the format strings using the [@]
  character. For instance, [@ ] means a space break, [@,] means a cut,
  [@\[] opens a new box, and [@\]] closes the last open box.

*)

val fprintf : formatter -> ('a, formatter, unit) format -> 'a

(** [fprintf ff fmt arg1 ... argN] formats the arguments [arg1] to [argN]
  according to the format string [fmt], and outputs the resulting string on
  the formatter [ff].

  The format string [fmt] is a character string which contains three types of
  objects: plain characters and conversion specifications as specified in
  the {!Printf} module, and pretty-printing indications specific to the
  [Format] module.

  The pretty-printing indication characters are introduced by
  a [@] character, and their meanings are:
  - [@\[]: open a pretty-printing box. The type and offset of the
    box may be optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional box type indication,
    then an optional integer offset, and the closing [>] character.
    Pretty-printing box type is one of [h], [v], [hv], [b], or [hov].
    '[h]' stands for an 'horizontal' pretty-printing box,
    '[v]' stands for a 'vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[hv]' stands for an 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[b]' stands for an 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box
    demonstrating indentation,
    '[hov]' stands a simple 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box.
    For instance, [@\[<hov 2>] opens an 'horizontal-or-vertical'
    pretty-printing box with indentation 2 as obtained with [open_hovbox 2].
    For more details about pretty-printing boxes, see the various box opening
    functions [open_*box].
  - [@\]]: close the most recently opened pretty-printing box.
  - [@,]: output a 'cut' break hint, as with [print_cut ()].
  - [@ ]: output a 'space' break hint, as with [print_space ()].
  - [@;]: output a 'full' break hint as with [print_break]. The
    [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break hint may be
    optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,
    then an integer [offset], and a closing [>] character.
    If no parameters are provided, the good break defaults to a
    'space' break hint.
  - [@.]: flush the pretty-printer and split the line, as with
    [print_newline ()].
  - [@<n>]: print the following item as if it were of length [n].
    Hence, [printf "@<0>%s" arg] prints [arg] as a zero length string.
    If [@<n>] is not followed by a conversion specification,
    then the following character of the format is printed as if
    it were of length [n].
  - [@\{]: open a semantic tag. The name of the tag may be optionally
    specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional string
    specification, and the closing [>] character. The string
    specification is any character string that does not contain the
    closing character ['>']. If omitted, the tag name defaults to the
    empty string.
    For more details about semantic tags, see the functions {!open_stag} and
    {!close_stag}.
  - [@\}]: close the most recently opened semantic tag.
  - [@?]: flush the pretty-printer as with [print_flush ()].
    This is equivalent to the conversion [%!].
  - [@\n]: force a newline, as with [force_newline ()], not the normal way
    of pretty-printing, you should prefer using break hints inside a vertical
    pretty-printing box.

  Note: To prevent the interpretation of a [@] character as a
  pretty-printing indication, escape it with a [%] character.
  Old quotation mode [@@] is deprecated since it is not compatible with
  formatted input interpretation of character ['@'].

  Example: [printf "@[%s@ %d@]@." "x =" 1] is equivalent to
  [open_box (); print_string "x ="; print_space ();
   print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()].
  It prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing 'horizontal-or-vertical' box.

val sprintf : ('a, unit, string) format -> 'a
(** Same as [printf] above, but instead of printing on a formatter,
  returns a string containing the result of formatting the arguments.
  Note that the pretty-printer queue is flushed at the end of {e each
  call} to [sprintf].

  In case of multiple and related calls to [sprintf] to output
  material on a single string, you should consider using [fprintf]
  with the predefined formatter [str_formatter] and call
  [flush_str_formatter ()] to get the final result.

  Alternatively, you can use [Format.fprintf] with a formatter writing to a
  buffer of your own: flushing the formatter and the buffer at the end of
  pretty-printing returns the desired string.
*)

val asprintf : ('a, formatter, unit, string) format4 -> 'a
(** Same as [printf] above, but instead of printing on a formatter,
  returns a string containing the result of formatting the arguments.
  The type of [asprintf] is general enough to interact nicely with [%a]
  conversions.

  @since 4.01.0
*)

val dprintf :
  ('a, formatter, unit, formatter -> unit) format4 -> 'a
(** Same as {!fprintf}, except the formatter is the last argument.
  [dprintf "..." a b c] is a function of type
  [formatter -> unit] which can be given to a format specifier [%t].

  This can be used as a replacement for {!asprintf} to delay
  formatting decisions. Using the string returned by {!asprintf} in a
  formatting context forces formatting decisions to be taken in
  isolation, and the final string may be created
  prematurely. {!dprintf} allows delay of formatting decisions until
  the final formatting context is known.
  For example:
{[
  let t = Format.dprintf "%i@ %i@ %i" 1 2 3 in
  ...
  Format.printf "@[<v>%t@]" t
]}

  @since 4.08.0

(** {2 Fundamentals} *)

(** {3 Promises} *)

type +'a t
(** Promises for values of type ['a].

    A {b promise} is a memory cell that is always in one of three {b states}:

    - {e fulfilled}, and containing one value of type ['a],
    - {e rejected}, and containing one exception, or
    - {e pending}, in which case it may become fulfilled or rejected later.

    A {e resolved} promise is one that is either fulfilled or rejected, i.e. not
    pending. Once a promise is resolved, its content cannot change. So, promises
    are {e write-once references}. The only possible state changes are (1) from
    pending to fulfilled and (2) from pending to rejected.

    Promises are typically “read” by attaching {b callbacks} to them. The most
    basic functions for that are {!Lwt.bind}, which attaches a callback that is
    called when a promise becomes fulfilled, and {!Lwt.catch}, for rejection.

    Promise variables of this type, ['a Lwt.t], are actually {b read-only} in
    Lwt. Separate {e resolvers} of type ['a ]{!Lwt.u} are used to write to them.
    Promises and their resolvers are created together by calling {!Lwt.wait}.
    There is one exception to this: most promises can be {e canceled} by calling
    {!Lwt.cancel}, without going through a resolver. *)

val return : 'a -> 'a t
(** [Lwt.return v] creates a new {{: #TYPEt} promise} that is {e already
    fulfilled} with value [v].

    This is needed to satisfy the type system in some cases. For example, in a
    [match] expression where one case evaluates to a promise, the other cases
    have to evaluate to promises as well:

{[
match need_input with
| true -> Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)   (* Has type string Lwt.t... *)
| false -> Lwt.return ""             (* ...so wrap empty string in a promise. *)
]}

    Another typical usage is in {{: #VALbind} [let%lwt]}. The expression after
    the “[in]” has to evaluate to a promise. So, if you compute an ordinary
    value instead, you have to wrap it:

{[
let%lwt line = Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) in
Lwt.return (line ^ ".")
]} *)


(** {3 Callbacks} *)

val bind : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t
(** [Lwt.bind p_1 f] makes it so that [f] will run when [p_1] is {{: #TYPEt}
    {e fulfilled}}.

    When [p_1] is fulfilled with value [v_1], the callback [f] is called with
    that same value [v_1]. Eventually, after perhaps starting some I/O or other
    computation, [f] returns promise [p_2].

    [Lwt.bind] itself returns immediately. It only attaches the callback [f] to
    [p_1] – it does not wait for [p_2]. {e What} [Lwt.bind] returns is yet a
    third promise, [p_3]. Roughly speaking, fulfillment of [p_3] represents both
    [p_1] and [p_2] becoming fulfilled, one after the other.

    A minimal example of this is an echo program:

{[
let () =
  let p_3 =
    Lwt.bind
      Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)
      (fun line -> Lwt_io.printl line)
  in
  Lwt_main.run p_3

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    Rejection of [p_1] and [p_2], and raising an exception in [f], are all
    forwarded to rejection of [p_3].

    {b Precise behavior}

    [Lwt.bind] returns a promise [p_3] immediately. [p_3] starts out pending,
    and is resolved as follows:

    - The first condition to wait for is that [p_1] becomes resolved. It does
      not matter whether [p_1] is already resolved when [Lwt.bind] is called, or
      becomes resolved later – the rest of the behavior is the same.
    - If and when [p_1] becomes resolved, it will, by definition, be either
      fulfilled or rejected.
    - If [p_1] is rejected, [p_3] is rejected with the same exception.
    - If [p_1] is fulfilled, with value [v], [f] is applied to [v].
    - [f] may finish by returning the promise [p_2], or raising an exception.
    - If [f] raises an exception, [p_3] is rejected with that exception.
    - Finally, the remaining case is when [f] returns [p_2]. From that point on,
      [p_3] is effectively made into a reference to [p_2]. This means they have
      the same state, undergo the same state changes, and performing any
      operation on one is equivalent to performing it on the other.

    {b Syntactic sugar}

    [Lwt.bind] is almost never written directly, because sequences of [Lwt.bind]
    result in growing indentation and many parentheses:

{[
let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    Lwt.bind Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) (fun line ->
      Lwt.bind (Lwt_unix.sleep 1.) (fun () ->
        Lwt_io.printf "One second ago, you entered %s\n" line))
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    The recommended way to write [Lwt.bind] is using the [let%lwt] syntactic
    sugar:

{[
let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    let%lwt line = Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) in
    let%lwt () = Lwt_unix.sleep 1. in
    Lwt_io.printf "One second ago, you entered %s\n" line
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt_ppx,lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    This uses the Lwt {{: Ppx_lwt.html} PPX} (preprocessor). Note that we had to
    add package [lwt_ppx] to the command line for building this program. We will
    do that throughout this manual.

    Another way to write [Lwt.bind], that you may encounter while reading code,
    is with the [>>=] operator:

{[
open Lwt.Infix

let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) >>= fun line ->
    Lwt_unix.sleep 1. >>= fun () ->
    Lwt_io.printf "One second ago, you entered %s\n" line
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    The [>>=] operator comes from the module {!Lwt.Infix}, which is why we
    opened it at the beginning of the program.

    See also {!Lwt.map}. *)



(** {2 Convenience} *)

(** {3 Callback helpers} *)

val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** [Lwt.map f p_1] is similar to {!Lwt.bind}[ p_1 f], but [f] is not expected
    to return a promise.

    This function is more convenient that {!Lwt.bind} when [f] inherently does
    not return a promise. An example is [Stdlib.int_of_string]:

{[
let read_int : unit -> int Lwt.t = fun () ->
  Lwt.map
    int_of_string
    Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)

let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    let%lwt number = read_int () in
    Lwt_io.printf "%i\n" number
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt_ppx,lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    By comparison, the {!Lwt.bind} version is more awkward:

{[
let read_int : unit -> int Lwt.t = fun () ->
  Lwt.bind
    Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)
    (fun line -> Lwt.return (int_of_string line))
]}

    As with {!Lwt.bind}, sequences of calls to [Lwt.map] result in excessive
    indentation and parentheses. The recommended syntactic sugar for avoiding
    this is the {{: #VAL(>|=)} [>|=]} operator, which comes from module
    [Lwt.Infix]:

{[
open Lwt.Infix

let read_int : unit -> int Lwt.t = fun () ->
  Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) >|= int_of_string
]}

    The detailed operation follows. For consistency with the promises in
    {!Lwt.bind}, the {e two} promises involved are named [p_1] and [p_3]:

    - [p_1] is the promise passed to [Lwt.map].
    - [p_3] is the promise returned by [Lwt.map].

    [Lwt.map] returns a promise [p_3]. [p_3] starts out pending. It is resolved
    as follows:

    - [p_1] may be, or become, resolved. In that case, by definition, it will
      become fulfilled or rejected. Fulfillment is the interesting case, but the
      behavior on rejection is simpler, so we focus on rejection first.
    - When [p_1] becomes rejected, [p_3] is rejected with the same exception.
    - When [p_1] instead becomes fulfilled, call the value it is fulfilled with
      [v].
    - [f v] is applied. If this finishes, it may either return another value, or
      raise an exception.
    - If [f v] returns another value [v'], [p_3] is fulfilled with [v'].
    - If [f v] raises exception [exn], [p_3] is rejected with [exn]. *)


(** {3 Pre-allocated promises} *)

val return_unit : unit t
(** [Lwt.return_unit] is defined as {!Lwt.return}[ ()], but this definition is
    evaluated only once, during initialization of module [Lwt], at the beginning
    of your program.

    This means the promise is allocated only once. By contrast, each time
    {!Lwt.return}[ ()] is evaluated, it allocates a new promise.

    It is recommended to use [Lwt.return_unit] only where you know the
    allocations caused by an instance of {!Lwt.return}[ ()] are a performance
    bottleneck. Generally, the cost of I/O tends to dominate the cost of
    {!Lwt.return}[ ()] anyway.

    In future Lwt, we hope to perform this optimization, of using a single,
    pre-allocated promise, automatically, wherever {!Lwt.return}[ ()] is
    written. *)

val return_none : (_ option) t
(** [Lwt.return_none] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for
    {!Lwt.return}[ None]. *)

val return_nil : (_ list) t
(** [Lwt.return_nil] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for {!Lwt.return}[ []]. *)

val return_true : bool t
(** [Lwt.return_true] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for
    {!Lwt.return}[ true]. *)

val return_false : bool t
(** [Lwt.return_false] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for
    {!Lwt.return}[ false]. *)

(** Sets over ordered types.

   This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
   function over the set elements. All operations over sets
   are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
   reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
   logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance.

   The {!Make} functor constructs implementations for any type, given a
   [compare] function.
   For instance:
   {[
     module IntPairs =
       struct
         type t = int * int
         let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =
           match Stdlib.compare x0 x1 with
               0 -> Stdlib.compare y0 y1
             | c -> c
       end

     module PairsSet = Set.Make(IntPairs)

     let m = PairsSet.(empty |> add (2,3) |> add (5,7) |> add (11,13))
   ]}

   This creates a new module [PairsSet], with a new type [PairsSet.t]
   of sets of [int * int].

(** Association tables over ordered types.

   This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
   finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
   over the keys.
   All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
   and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

   For instance:
   {[
     module IntPairs =
       struct
         type t = int * int
         let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =
           match Stdlib.compare x0 x1 with
               0 -> Stdlib.compare y0 y1
             | c -> c
       end

     module PairsMap = Map.Make(IntPairs)

     let m = PairsMap.(empty |> add (0,1) "hello" |> add (1,0) "world")
   ]}

   This creates a new module [PairsMap], with a new type ['a PairsMap.t]
   of maps from [int * int] to ['a]. In this example, [m] contains [string]
   values so its type is [string PairsMap.t].
*)

module type OrderedType =
  sig
    type t
      (** The type of the map keys. *)

    val compare : t -> t -> int
      (** A total ordering function over the keys.
          This is a two-argument function [f] such that
          [f e1 e2] is zero if the keys [e1] and [e2] are equal,
          [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
          and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2].
          Example: a suitable ordering function is the generic structural
          comparison function {!Stdlib.compare}. *)
  end

   This module provides support for type equalities and runtime type identifiers.

   For two types [a] and [b], [(a, b) eq] is a witness that [a = b]. This is
   a standard generalized algebraic datatype on top of which type-level
   programming techniques can be implemented.

   Given a type [a], an inhabitant of [a t] is a dynamic identifier for [a].
   Identifiers can be compared for equality. They are also equipped with a
   hash function.

   WARNING: the hash function changes at every run. Therefore, the result
   of the hash function should never be stored.

   Notice that dynamic identifiers are not unique: two identifiers for [a]
   can have distinct hash and can be physically distinct. Hence, only [eq]
   can decide if two type identifiers correspond to the same type.

*)
