(** {1 Operations on format strings} *)

(** Format strings are character strings with special lexical conventions
  that defines the functionality of formatted input/output functions. Format
  strings are used to read data with formatted input functions from module
  {!Scanf} and to print data with formatted output functions from modules
  {!Printf} and {!Format}.

  Format strings are made of three kinds of entities:
  - {e conversions specifications}, introduced by the special character ['%']
    followed by one or more characters specifying what kind of argument to
    read or print,
  - {e formatting indications}, introduced by the special character ['@']
    followed by one or more characters specifying how to read or print the
    argument,
  - {e plain characters} that are regular characters with usual lexical
    conventions. Plain characters specify string literals to be read in the
    input or printed in the output.

  There is an additional lexical rule to escape the special characters ['%']
  and ['@'] in format strings: if a special character follows a ['%']
  character, it is treated as a plain character. In other words, ["%%"] is
  considered as a plain ['%'] and ["%@"] as a plain ['@'].

  For more information about conversion specifications and formatting
  indications available, read the documentation of modules {!Scanf},
  {!Printf} and {!Format}.
*)

(** Format strings have a general and highly polymorphic type
    [('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f) format6].
    The two simplified types, [format] and [format4] below are
    included for backward compatibility with earlier releases of
    OCaml.

    The meaning of format string type parameters is as follows:

    - ['a] is the type of the parameters of the format for formatted output
      functions ([printf]-style functions);
      ['a] is the type of the values read by the format for formatted input
      functions ([scanf]-style functions).

    - ['b] is the type of input source for formatted input functions and the
      type of output target for formatted output functions.
      For [printf]-style functions from module {!Printf}, ['b] is typically
      [out_channel];
      for [printf]-style functions from module {!Format}, ['b] is typically
      {!Format.formatter};
      for [scanf]-style functions from module {!Scanf}, ['b] is typically
      {!Scanf.Scanning.in_channel}.

      Type argument ['b] is also the type of the first argument given to
      user's defined printing functions for [%a] and [%t] conversions,
      and user's defined reading functions for [%r] conversion.

    - ['c] is the type of the result of the [%a] and [%t] printing
      functions, and also the type of the argument transmitted to the
      first argument of [kprintf]-style functions or to the
      [kscanf]-style functions.

    - ['d] is the type of parameters for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['e] is the type of the receiver function for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['f] is the final result type of a formatted input/output function
      invocation: for the [printf]-style functions, it is typically [unit];
      for the [scanf]-style functions, it is typically the result type of the
      receiver function.

(** Either type.

    Either is the simplest and most generic sum/variant type:
    a value of [('a, 'b) Either.t] is either a [Left (v : 'a)]
    or a [Right (v : 'b)].

    It is a natural choice in the API of generic functions where values
    could fall in two different cases, possibly at different types,
    without assigning a specific meaning to what each case should be.

    For example:

{[List.partition_map:
    ('a -> ('b, 'c) Either.t) -> 'a list -> 'b list * 'c list]}

    If you are looking for a parametrized type where
    one alternative means success and the other means failure,
    you should use the more specific type {!Result.t}.

    @since 4.12
*)

(* Unlike [result], no [either] type is made available in Stdlib,
   one needs to access [Either.t] explicitly:

   - This type is less common in typical OCaml codebases,
     which prefer domain-specific variant types whose constructors
     carry more meaning.
   - Adding this to Stdlib would raise warnings in existing codebases
     that already use a constructor named Left or Right:
     + when opening a module that exports such a name,
       warning 45 is raised
     + adding a second constructor of the same name in scope kicks
       in the disambiguation mechanisms, and warning 41 may now
       be raised by existing code.

   If the use becomes more common in the future we can always
   revisit this choice.

(** String operations.

  A string is an immutable data structure that contains a
  fixed-length sequence of (single-byte) characters. Each character
  can be accessed in constant time through its index.

  Given a string [s] of length [l], we can access each of the [l]
  characters of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
  [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
  range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
  characters or at the beginning or end of the string.  We call a
  position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
  (inclusive). Note that the character at index [n] is between
  positions [n] and [n+1].

  Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
  substring of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are
  valid positions in [s].

  Note: OCaml strings used to be modifiable in place, for instance via
  the {!String.set} and {!String.blit} functions described below. This
  usage is only possible when the compiler is put in "unsafe-string"
  mode by giving the [-unsafe-string] command-line option. This
  compatibility mode makes the types [string] and [bytes] (see module
  {!Bytes}) interchangeable so that functions expecting byte sequences
  can also accept strings as arguments and modify them.

  The distinction between [bytes] and [string] was introduced in OCaml
  4.02, and the "unsafe-string" compatibility mode was the default
  until OCaml 4.05. Starting with 4.06, the compatibility mode is
  opt-in; we intend to remove the option in the future.

(** Byte sequence operations.

   A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a
   fixed-length sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in
   constant time for reading or writing.

   Given a byte sequence [s] of length [l], we can access each of the
   [l] bytes of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
   [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
   range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
   bytes or at the beginning or end of the sequence.  We call a
   position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
   (inclusive). Note that the byte at index [n] is between positions
   [n] and [n+1].

   Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
   range of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are valid
   positions in [s].

   Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the [set]
   and [blit] functions described below.  See also strings (module
   {!String}), which are almost the same data structure, but cannot be
   modified in place.

   Bytes are represented by the OCaml type [char].

   The labeled version of this module can be used as described in the
   {!StdLabels} module.

(** 32-bit integers.

   This module provides operations on the type [int32]
   of signed 32-bit integers.  Unlike the built-in [int] type,
   the type [int32] is guaranteed to be exactly 32-bit wide on all
   platforms.  All arithmetic operations over [int32] are taken
   modulo 2{^32}.

   Performance notice: values of type [int32] occupy more memory
   space than values of type [int], and arithmetic operations on
   [int32] are generally slower than those on [int].  Use [int32]
   only when the application requires exact 32-bit arithmetic.

(** Pretty-printing.

   This module implements a pretty-printing facility to format values
   within {{!boxes}'pretty-printing boxes'} and {{!tags}'semantic tags'}
   combined with a set of {{!fpp}printf-like functions}.
   The pretty-printer splits lines at specified {{!breaks}break hints},
   and indents lines according to the box structure.
   Similarly, {{!tags}semantic tags} can be used to decouple text
   presentation from its contents.

   This pretty-printing facility is implemented as an overlay on top of
   abstract {{!section:formatter}formatters} which provide basic output
   functions.
   Some formatters are predefined, notably:
   - {!std_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stdout}stdout}
   - {!err_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stderr}stderr}

   Most functions in the {!Format} module come in two variants:
   a short version that operates on {!std_formatter} and the
   generic version prefixed by [pp_] that takes a formatter
   as its first argument.

   More formatters can be created with {!formatter_of_out_channel},
   {!formatter_of_buffer}, {!formatter_of_symbolic_output_buffer}
   or using {{!section:formatter}custom formatters}.

*)

(** {1 Introduction}
   For a gentle introduction to the basics of pretty-printing using
   [Format], read
   {{:http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}
    http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}.

   You may consider this module as providing an extension to the
   [printf] facility to provide automatic line splitting. The addition of
   pretty-printing annotations to your regular [printf] format strings gives
   you fancy indentation and line breaks.
   Pretty-printing annotations are described below in the documentation of
   the function {!Format.fprintf}.

   You may also use the explicit pretty-printing box management and printing
   functions provided by this module. This style is more basic but more
   verbose than the concise [fprintf] format strings.

   For instance, the sequence
   [open_box 0; print_string "x ="; print_space ();
    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()]
   that prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing box, can be
   abbreviated as [printf "@[%s@ %i@]@." "x =" 1], or even shorter
   [printf "@[x =@ %i@]@." 1].

   Rule of thumb for casual users of this library:
 - use simple pretty-printing boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);
 - use simple break hints as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a
   simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that outputs a space
   indicating a break hint;
 - once a pretty-printing box is open, display its material with basic
   printing functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);
 - when the material for a pretty-printing box has been printed, call
   [close_box ()] to close the box;
 - at the end of pretty-printing, flush the pretty-printer to display all
   the remaining material, e.g. evaluate [print_newline ()].

   The behavior of pretty-printing commands is unspecified
   if there is no open pretty-printing box. Each box opened by
   one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]
   for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the
   boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly.

   In case of interactive use, each phrase is executed in the initial state
   of the standard pretty-printer: after each phrase execution, the
   interactive system closes all open pretty-printing boxes, flushes all
   pending text, and resets the standard pretty-printer.

   Warning: mixing calls to pretty-printing functions of this module with
   calls to {!Stdlib} low level output functions is error prone.

   The pretty-printing functions output material that is delayed in the
   pretty-printer queue and stacks in order to compute proper line
   splitting. In contrast, basic I/O output functions write directly in
   their output device. As a consequence, the output of a basic I/O function
   may appear before the output of a pretty-printing function that has been
   called before. For instance,
   [
    Stdlib.print_string "<";
    Format.print_string "PRETTY";
    Stdlib.print_string ">";

type formatter
(** Abstract data corresponding to a pretty-printer (also called a
    formatter) and all its machinery. See also {!section:formatter}. *)

(** {1:boxes Pretty-printing boxes} *)

(** The pretty-printing engine uses the concepts of pretty-printing box and
  break hint to drive indentation and line splitting behavior of the
  pretty-printer.

  Each different pretty-printing box kind introduces a specific line splitting
  policy:

  - within an {e horizontal} box, break hints never split the line (but the
    line may be split in a box nested deeper),
  - within a {e vertical} box, break hints always split the line,
  - within an {e horizontal/vertical} box, if the box fits on the current line
    then break hints never split the line, otherwise break hint always split
    the line,
  - within a {e compacting} box, a break hint never splits the line,
    unless there is no more room on the current line.

  Note that line splitting policy is box specific: the policy of a box does
  not rule the policy of inner boxes. For instance, if a vertical box is
  nested in an horizontal box, all break hints within the vertical box will
  split the line.

  Moreover, opening a box after the {{!maxindent}maximum indentation limit}
  splits the line whether or not the box would end up fitting on the line.

*)

val pp_open_box : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_box ppf d] opens a new compacting pretty-printing box with
    offset [d] in the formatter [ppf].

   Within this box, the pretty-printer prints as much as possible material on
   every line.

   A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
   print the remainder of the box.

   Within this box, the pretty-printer emphasizes the box structure:
   if a structural box does not fit fully on a simple line, a break
   hint also splits the line if the splitting ``moves to the left''
   (i.e. the new line gets an indentation smaller than the one of the current
   line).

   This box is the general purpose pretty-printing box.

   If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, offset [d] is added to
   the current indentation.
*)


val pp_close_box : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Closes the most recently open pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_open_hbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [pp_open_hbox ppf ()] opens a new 'horizontal' pretty-printing box.

  This box prints material on a single line.

  Break hints in a horizontal box never split the line.
  (Line splitting may still occur inside boxes nested deeper).
*)

val pp_open_vbox : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_vbox ppf d] opens a new 'vertical' pretty-printing box
  with offset [d].

  This box prints material on as many lines as break hints in the box.

  Every break hint in a vertical box splits the line.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

val pp_open_hvbox : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_hvbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box
  with offset [d].

  This box behaves as an horizontal box if it fits on a single line,
  otherwise it behaves as a vertical box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

val pp_open_hovbox : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_open_hovbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal-or-vertical'
  pretty-printing box with offset [d].

  This box prints material as much as possible on every line.

  A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
  print the remainder of the box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

(** {1 Formatting functions} *)

val pp_print_string : formatter -> string -> unit
(** [pp_print_string ppf s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_as : formatter -> int -> string -> unit
(** [pp_print_as ppf len s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box.
  The pretty-printer formats [s] as if it were of length [len].
*)

val pp_print_int : formatter -> int -> unit
(** Print an integer in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_char : formatter -> char -> unit
(** Print a character in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_bool : formatter -> bool -> unit
(** Print a boolean in the current pretty-printing box. *)

(** {1:breaks Break hints} *)

(** A 'break hint' tells the pretty-printer to output some space or split the
  line whichever way is more appropriate to the current pretty-printing box
  splitting rules.

  Break hints are used to separate printing items and are mandatory to let
  the pretty-printer correctly split lines and indent items.

  Simple break hints are:
  - the 'space': output a space or split the line if appropriate,
  - the 'cut': split the line if appropriate.

  Note: the notions of space and line splitting are abstract for the
  pretty-printing engine, since those notions can be completely redefined
  by the programmer.
  However, in the pretty-printer default setting, ``output a space'' simply
  means printing a space character (ASCII code 32) and ``split the line''
  means printing a newline character (ASCII code 10).
*)

val pp_print_space : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [pp_print_space ppf ()] emits a 'space' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints one space.

  [pp_print_space ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 1 0].
*)

val pp_print_cut : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [pp_print_cut ppf ()] emits a 'cut' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints nothing.

  [pp_print_cut ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 0 0].
*)

val pp_print_break : formatter -> int -> int -> unit
(** [pp_print_break ppf nspaces offset] emits a 'full' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints [nspaces] spaces.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
  the current indentation.
*)

val pp_print_custom_break :
  formatter ->
  fits:(string * int * string) ->
  breaks:(string * int * string) ->
  unit
(** [pp_print_custom_break ppf ~fits:(s1, n, s2) ~breaks:(s3, m, s4)] emits a
   custom break hint: the pretty-printer may split the line at this point.

   If it does not split the line, then the [s1] is emitted, then [n] spaces,
   then [s2].

   If it splits the line, then it emits the [s3] string, then an indent
   (according to the box rules), then an offset of [m] spaces, then the [s4]
   string.

   While [n] and [m] are handled by [formatter_out_functions.out_indent], the
   strings will be handled by [formatter_out_functions.out_string]. This allows
   for a custom formatter that handles indentation distinctly, for example,
   outputs [<br/>] tags or [&nbsp;] entities.

   The custom break is useful if you want to change which visible
   (non-whitespace) characters are printed in case of break or no break. For
   example, when printing a list [ [a; b; c] ], you might want to add a
   trailing semicolon when it is printed vertically:

   {[
[
  a;
  b;
  c;
]
   ]}

   You can do this as follows:
   {[
printf "@[<v 0>[@;<0 2>@[<v 0>a;@,b;@,c@]%t]@]@\n"
  (pp_print_custom_break ~fits:("", 0, "") ~breaks:(";", 0, ""))
   ]}

  @since 4.08.0
*)

val pp_force_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Force a new line in the current pretty-printing box.

  The pretty-printer must split the line at this point,

  Not the normal way of pretty-printing, since imperative line splitting may
  interfere with current line counters and box size calculation.
  Using break hints within an enclosing vertical box is a better
  alternative.
*)

val pp_print_if_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Execute the next formatting command if the preceding line
  has just been split. Otherwise, ignore the next formatting
  command.
*)

(** {1 Pretty-printing termination} *)

val pp_print_flush : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

  All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.
  In addition, the pretty-printer low level output device is flushed to
  ensure that all pending text is really displayed.

  Note: never use [print_flush] in the normal course of a pretty-printing
  routine, since the pretty-printer uses a complex buffering machinery to
  properly indent the output; manually flushing those buffers at random
  would conflict with the pretty-printer strategy and result to poor
  rendering.

  Only consider using [print_flush] when displaying all pending material is
  mandatory (for instance in case of interactive use when you want the user
  to read some text) and when resetting the pretty-printer state will not
  disturb further pretty-printing.

  Warning: If the output device of the pretty-printer is an output channel,
  repeated calls to [print_flush] means repeated calls to {!Stdlib.flush}
  to flush the out channel; these explicit flush calls could foil the
  buffering strategy of output channels and could dramatically impact
  efficiency.
*)

val pp_print_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

  All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.

  Equivalent to {!print_flush} followed by a new line.
  See corresponding words of caution for {!print_flush}.

  Note: this is not the normal way to output a new line;
  the preferred method is using break hints within a vertical pretty-printing
  box.
*)

(** {1 Margin} *)

val pp_set_margin : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_set_margin ppf d] sets the right margin to [d] (in characters):
  the pretty-printer splits lines that overflow the right margin according to
  the break hints given.
  Setting the margin to [d] means that the formatting engine aims at
  printing at most [d-1] characters per line.
  Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.
  If [d] is too large, the right margin is set to the maximum
  admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).
  If [d] is less than the current maximum indentation limit, the
  maximum indentation limit is decreased while trying to preserve
  a minimal ratio [max_indent/margin>=50%] and if possible
  the current difference [margin - max_indent].

  See also {!pp_set_geometry}.
*)

val pp_get_margin : formatter -> unit -> int
(** Returns the position of the right margin. *)

(** {1:maxindent Maximum indentation limit} *)

val pp_set_max_indent : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_set_max_indent ppf d] sets the maximum indentation limit of lines
  to [d] (in characters):
  once this limit is reached, new pretty-printing boxes are rejected to the
  left, unless the enclosing box fully fits on the current line.
  As an illustration,
  {[ set_margin 10; set_max_indent 5; printf "@[123456@[7@]89A@]@." ]}
  yields
  {[
    123456
    789A
  ]}
  because the nested box ["@[7@]"] is opened after the maximum indentation
  limit ([7>5]) and its parent box does not fit on the current line.
  Either decreasing the length of the parent box to make it fit on a line:
  {[ printf "@[123456@[7@]89@]@." ]}
  or opening an intermediary box before the maximum indentation limit which
  fits on the current line
  {[ printf "@[123@[456@[7@]89@]A@]@." ]}
  avoids the rejection to the left of the inner boxes and print respectively
  ["123456789"] and ["123456789A"] .
  Note also that vertical boxes never fit on a line whereas horizontal boxes
  always fully fit on the current line.
  Opening a box may split a line whereas the contents may have fit.
  If this behavior is problematic, it can be curtailed by setting the maximum
  indentation limit to [margin - 1]. Note that setting the maximum indentation
  limit to [margin] is invalid.

  Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.

  If [d] is too large, the limit is set to the maximum
  admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).

  If [d] is greater or equal than the current margin, it is ignored,
  and the current maximum indentation limit is kept.

  See also {!pp_set_geometry}.
*)

val pp_get_max_indent : formatter -> unit -> int
(** Return the maximum indentation limit (in characters). *)

(** {1 Maximum formatting depth} *)

(** The maximum formatting depth is the maximum number of pretty-printing
  boxes simultaneously open.

  Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an ellipsis (more
  precisely as the text returned by {!get_ellipsis_text} [()]).
*)

val pp_set_max_boxes : formatter -> int -> unit
(** [pp_set_max_boxes ppf max] sets the maximum number of pretty-printing
    boxes simultaneously open.

  Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an ellipsis (more
  precisely as the text returned by {!get_ellipsis_text} [()]).

  Nothing happens if [max] is smaller than 2.
*)

val pp_get_max_boxes : formatter -> unit -> int

(** Tests if the maximum number of pretty-printing boxes allowed have already
  been opened.
*)

(** {1 Tabulation boxes} *)

(**

  A {e tabulation box} prints material on lines divided into cells of fixed
  length. A tabulation box provides a simple way to display vertical columns
  of left adjusted text.

  This box features command [set_tab] to define cell boundaries, and command
  [print_tab] to move from cell to cell and split the line when there is no
  more cells to print on the line.

  Note: printing within tabulation box is line directed, so arbitrary line
  splitting inside a tabulation box leads to poor rendering. Yet, controlled
  use of tabulation boxes allows simple printing of columns within
  module {!Format}.
*)

val pp_open_tbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** [open_tbox ()] opens a new tabulation box.

  This box prints lines separated into cells of fixed width.

  Inside a tabulation box, special {e tabulation markers} defines points of
  interest on the line (for instance to delimit cell boundaries).
  Function {!Format.set_tab} sets a tabulation marker at insertion point.

  A tabulation box features specific {e tabulation breaks} to move to next
  tabulation marker or split the line. Function {!Format.print_tbreak} prints
  a tabulation break.

val pp_close_tbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Closes the most recently opened tabulation box. *)

val pp_set_tab : formatter -> unit -> unit
(** Sets a tabulation marker at current insertion point. *)

val pp_print_tab : formatter -> unit -> unit

  a tabulation marker, the insertion point moves to the first tabulation
  marker on the right, or the pretty-printer splits the line and insertion
  point moves to the leftmost tabulation marker.

  It is equivalent to [print_tbreak 0 0]. *)

val pp_print_tbreak : formatter -> int -> int -> unit
(** [print_tbreak nspaces offset] emits a 'full' tabulation break hint.

  If not already set on a tabulation marker, the insertion point moves to the
  first tabulation marker on the right and the pretty-printer prints
  [nspaces] spaces.

  If there is no next tabulation marker on the right, the pretty-printer
  splits the line at this point, then insertion point moves to the leftmost
  tabulation marker of the box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
  the current indentation.

(** {1:fpp Formatted pretty-printing} *)

(**
  Module [Format] provides a complete set of [printf] like functions for
  pretty-printing using format string specifications.

  Specific annotations may be added in the format strings to give
  pretty-printing commands to the pretty-printing engine.

  Those annotations are introduced in the format strings using the [@]
  character. For instance, [@ ] means a space break, [@,] means a cut,
  [@\[] opens a new box, and [@\]] closes the last open box.

*)

val fprintf : formatter -> ('a, formatter, unit) format -> 'a

(** [fprintf ff fmt arg1 ... argN] formats the arguments [arg1] to [argN]
  according to the format string [fmt], and outputs the resulting string on
  the formatter [ff].

  The format string [fmt] is a character string which contains three types of
  objects: plain characters and conversion specifications as specified in
  the {!Printf} module, and pretty-printing indications specific to the
  [Format] module.

  The pretty-printing indication characters are introduced by
  a [@] character, and their meanings are:
  - [@\[]: open a pretty-printing box. The type and offset of the
    box may be optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional box type indication,
    then an optional integer offset, and the closing [>] character.
    Pretty-printing box type is one of [h], [v], [hv], [b], or [hov].
    '[h]' stands for an 'horizontal' pretty-printing box,
    '[v]' stands for a 'vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[hv]' stands for an 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[b]' stands for an 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box
    demonstrating indentation,
    '[hov]' stands a simple 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box.
    For instance, [@\[<hov 2>] opens an 'horizontal-or-vertical'
    pretty-printing box with indentation 2 as obtained with [open_hovbox 2].
    For more details about pretty-printing boxes, see the various box opening
    functions [open_*box].
  - [@\]]: close the most recently opened pretty-printing box.
  - [@,]: output a 'cut' break hint, as with [print_cut ()].
  - [@ ]: output a 'space' break hint, as with [print_space ()].
  - [@;]: output a 'full' break hint as with [print_break]. The
    [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break hint may be
    optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,
    then an integer [offset], and a closing [>] character.
    If no parameters are provided, the good break defaults to a
    'space' break hint.
  - [@.]: flush the pretty-printer and split the line, as with
    [print_newline ()].
  - [@<n>]: print the following item as if it were of length [n].
    Hence, [printf "@<0>%s" arg] prints [arg] as a zero length string.
    If [@<n>] is not followed by a conversion specification,
    then the following character of the format is printed as if
    it were of length [n].
  - [@\{]: open a semantic tag. The name of the tag may be optionally
    specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional string
    specification, and the closing [>] character. The string
    specification is any character string that does not contain the
    closing character ['>']. If omitted, the tag name defaults to the
    empty string.
    For more details about semantic tags, see the functions {!open_stag} and
    {!close_stag}.
  - [@\}]: close the most recently opened semantic tag.
  - [@?]: flush the pretty-printer as with [print_flush ()].
    This is equivalent to the conversion [%!].
  - [@\n]: force a newline, as with [force_newline ()], not the normal way
    of pretty-printing, you should prefer using break hints inside a vertical
    pretty-printing box.

  Note: To prevent the interpretation of a [@] character as a
  pretty-printing indication, escape it with a [%] character.
  Old quotation mode [@@] is deprecated since it is not compatible with
  formatted input interpretation of character ['@'].

  Example: [printf "@[%s@ %d@]@." "x =" 1] is equivalent to
  [open_box (); print_string "x ="; print_space ();
   print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()].
  It prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing 'horizontal-or-vertical' box.

*)

val sprintf : ('a, unit, string) format -> 'a
(** Same as [printf] above, but instead of printing on a formatter,
  returns a string containing the result of formatting the arguments.
  Note that the pretty-printer queue is flushed at the end of {e each
  call} to [sprintf].

  In case of multiple and related calls to [sprintf] to output
  material on a single string, you should consider using [fprintf]
  with the predefined formatter [str_formatter] and call
  [flush_str_formatter ()] to get the final result.

  Alternatively, you can use [Format.fprintf] with a formatter writing to a
  buffer of your own: flushing the formatter and the buffer at the end of
  pretty-printing returns the desired string.
*)

val asprintf : ('a, formatter, unit, string) format4 -> 'a
(** Same as [printf] above, but instead of printing on a formatter,
  returns a string containing the result of formatting the arguments.
  The type of [asprintf] is general enough to interact nicely with [%a]
  conversions.

  @since 4.01.0
*)

val dprintf :
  ('a, formatter, unit, formatter -> unit) format4 -> 'a
(** Same as {!fprintf}, except the formatter is the last argument.
  [dprintf "..." a b c] is a function of type
  [formatter -> unit] which can be given to a format specifier [%t].

  This can be used as a replacement for {!asprintf} to delay
  formatting decisions. Using the string returned by {!asprintf} in a
  formatting context forces formatting decisions to be taken in
  isolation, and the final string may be created
  prematurely. {!dprintf} allows delay of formatting decisions until
  the final formatting context is known.
  For example:
{[
  let t = Format.dprintf "%i@ %i@ %i" 1 2 3 in
  ...
  Format.printf "@[<v>%t@]" t
]}

   Integers.

   This modules provides arbitrary-precision integers.
   Small integers internally use a regular OCaml [int].
   When numbers grow too large, we switch transparently to GMP numbers
   ([mpn] numbers fully allocated on the OCaml heap).

   This interface is rather similar to that of [Int32] and [Int64],
   with some additional functions provided natively by GMP
   (GCD, square root, pop-count, etc.).

(** {2 Fundamentals} *)

(** {3 Promises} *)

type +'a t
(** Promises for values of type ['a].

    A {b promise} is a memory cell that is always in one of three {b states}:

    - {e fulfilled}, and containing one value of type ['a],
    - {e rejected}, and containing one exception, or
    - {e pending}, in which case it may become fulfilled or rejected later.

    A {e resolved} promise is one that is either fulfilled or rejected, i.e. not
    pending. Once a promise is resolved, its content cannot change. So, promises
    are {e write-once references}. The only possible state changes are (1) from
    pending to fulfilled and (2) from pending to rejected.

    Promises are typically “read” by attaching {b callbacks} to them. The most
    basic functions for that are {!Lwt.bind}, which attaches a callback that is
    called when a promise becomes fulfilled, and {!Lwt.catch}, for rejection.

    Promise variables of this type, ['a Lwt.t], are actually {b read-only} in
    Lwt. Separate {e resolvers} of type ['a ]{!Lwt.u} are used to write to them.
    Promises and their resolvers are created together by calling {!Lwt.wait}.
    There is one exception to this: most promises can be {e canceled} by calling
    {!Lwt.cancel}, without going through a resolver. *)

(** We omit [u], [wait], [wakeup*] and so on because these are only useful to
    define new synchronization primitives which the protocol doesn't need: it
    gets its synchronization primitives from the environment. *)

val return : 'a -> 'a t
(** [Lwt.return v] creates a new {{: #TYPEt} promise} that is {e already
    fulfilled} with value [v].

    This is needed to satisfy the type system in some cases. For example, in a
    [match] expression where one case evaluates to a promise, the other cases
    have to evaluate to promises as well:

{[
match need_input with
| true -> Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)   (* Has type string Lwt.t... *)
| false -> Lwt.return ""             (* ...so wrap empty string in a promise. *)
]}

    Another typical usage is in {{: #VALbind} [let%lwt]}. The expression after
    the “[in]” has to evaluate to a promise. So, if you compute an ordinary
    value instead, you have to wrap it:

{[
let%lwt line = Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) in
Lwt.return (line ^ ".")
]} *)

(** We omit [fail] as well as [catch] and such because we discourage the use of
    exceptions in the environment. The Error Monad provides sufficient
    primitives. *)

(** {3 Callbacks} *)

val bind : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t
(** [Lwt.bind p_1 f] makes it so that [f] will run when [p_1] is {{: #TYPEt}
    {e fulfilled}}.

    When [p_1] is fulfilled with value [v_1], the callback [f] is called with
    that same value [v_1]. Eventually, after perhaps starting some I/O or other
    computation, [f] returns promise [p_2].

    [Lwt.bind] itself returns immediately. It only attaches the callback [f] to
    [p_1] – it does not wait for [p_2]. {e What} [Lwt.bind] returns is yet a
    third promise, [p_3]. Roughly speaking, fulfillment of [p_3] represents both
    [p_1] and [p_2] becoming fulfilled, one after the other.

    A minimal example of this is an echo program:

{[
let () =
  let p_3 =
    Lwt.bind
      Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)
      (fun line -> Lwt_io.printl line)
  in
  Lwt_main.run p_3

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    Rejection of [p_1] and [p_2], and raising an exception in [f], are all
    forwarded to rejection of [p_3].

    {b Precise behavior}

    [Lwt.bind] returns a promise [p_3] immediately. [p_3] starts out pending,
    and is resolved as follows:

    - The first condition to wait for is that [p_1] becomes resolved. It does
      not matter whether [p_1] is already resolved when [Lwt.bind] is called, or
      becomes resolved later – the rest of the behavior is the same.
    - If and when [p_1] becomes resolved, it will, by definition, be either
      fulfilled or rejected.
    - If [p_1] is rejected, [p_3] is rejected with the same exception.
    - If [p_1] is fulfilled, with value [v], [f] is applied to [v].
    - [f] may finish by returning the promise [p_2], or raising an exception.
    - If [f] raises an exception, [p_3] is rejected with that exception.
    - Finally, the remaining case is when [f] returns [p_2]. From that point on,
      [p_3] is effectively made into a reference to [p_2]. This means they have
      the same state, undergo the same state changes, and performing any
      operation on one is equivalent to performing it on the other.

    {b Syntactic sugar}

    [Lwt.bind] is almost never written directly, because sequences of [Lwt.bind]
    result in growing indentation and many parentheses:

{[
let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    Lwt.bind Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) (fun line ->
      Lwt.bind (Lwt_unix.sleep 1.) (fun () ->
        Lwt_io.printf "One second ago, you entered %s\n" line))
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    The recommended way to write [Lwt.bind] is using the [let%lwt] syntactic
    sugar:

{[
let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    let%lwt line = Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) in
    let%lwt () = Lwt_unix.sleep 1. in
    Lwt_io.printf "One second ago, you entered %s\n" line
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt_ppx,lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    This uses the Lwt {{: Ppx_lwt.html} PPX} (preprocessor). Note that we had to
    add package [lwt_ppx] to the command line for building this program. We will
    do that throughout this manual.

    Another way to write [Lwt.bind], that you may encounter while reading code,
    is with the [>>=] operator:

{[
open Lwt.Infix

let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) >>= fun line ->
    Lwt_unix.sleep 1. >>= fun () ->
    Lwt_io.printf "One second ago, you entered %s\n" line
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    The [>>=] operator comes from the module {!Lwt.Infix}, which is why we
    opened it at the beginning of the program.

    See also {!Lwt.map}. *)



(** We omit [dont_wait] and other such functions because they are only useful
    in mutation-heavy loosely-synchronised code which the protocol shouldn't be.
    *)

(** We omit many synchronisation primitives such as [choose] because they
    introduce non-determinism. *)

(** We omit cancelation-related primitives because we discourage Cancelation in
    the protocol. *)

(** {2 Convenience} *)

(** {3 Callback helpers} *)

val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** [Lwt.map f p_1] is similar to {!Lwt.bind}[ p_1 f], but [f] is not expected
    to return a promise.

    This function is more convenient that {!Lwt.bind} when [f] inherently does
    not return a promise. An example is [Stdlib.int_of_string]:

{[
let read_int : unit -> int Lwt.t = fun () ->
  Lwt.map
    int_of_string
    Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)

let () =
  Lwt_main.run begin
    let%lwt number = read_int () in
    Lwt_io.printf "%i\n" number
  end

(* ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -thread -package lwt_ppx,lwt.unix code.ml && ./a.out *)
]}

    By comparison, the {!Lwt.bind} version is more awkward:

{[
let read_int : unit -> int Lwt.t = fun () ->
  Lwt.bind
    Lwt_io.(read_line stdin)
    (fun line -> Lwt.return (int_of_string line))
]}

    As with {!Lwt.bind}, sequences of calls to [Lwt.map] result in excessive
    indentation and parentheses. The recommended syntactic sugar for avoiding
    this is the {{: #VAL(>|=)} [>|=]} operator, which comes from module
    [Lwt.Infix]:

{[
open Lwt.Infix

let read_int : unit -> int Lwt.t = fun () ->
  Lwt_io.(read_line stdin) >|= int_of_string
]}

    The detailed operation follows. For consistency with the promises in
    {!Lwt.bind}, the {e two} promises involved are named [p_1] and [p_3]:

    - [p_1] is the promise passed to [Lwt.map].
    - [p_3] is the promise returned by [Lwt.map].

    [Lwt.map] returns a promise [p_3]. [p_3] starts out pending. It is resolved
    as follows:

    - [p_1] may be, or become, resolved. In that case, by definition, it will
      become fulfilled or rejected. Fulfillment is the interesting case, but the
      behavior on rejection is simpler, so we focus on rejection first.
    - When [p_1] becomes rejected, [p_3] is rejected with the same exception.
    - When [p_1] instead becomes fulfilled, call the value it is fulfilled with
      [v].
    - [f v] is applied. If this finishes, it may either return another value, or
      raise an exception.
    - If [f v] returns another value [v'], [p_3] is fulfilled with [v'].
    - If [f v] raises exception [exn], [p_3] is rejected with [exn]. *)

(** We omit explicit callback registration ([on_termination] and such) because
    it is only useful for mutation-heavy code *)

(** We omit syntax helpers because they are available through the dedicated
    syntax modules of the Error Monad. *)

(** {3 Pre-allocated promises} *)

val return_unit : unit t
(** [Lwt.return_unit] is defined as {!Lwt.return}[ ()], but this definition is
    evaluated only once, during initialization of module [Lwt], at the beginning
    of your program.

    This means the promise is allocated only once. By contrast, each time
    {!Lwt.return}[ ()] is evaluated, it allocates a new promise.

    It is recommended to use [Lwt.return_unit] only where you know the
    allocations caused by an instance of {!Lwt.return}[ ()] are a performance
    bottleneck. Generally, the cost of I/O tends to dominate the cost of
    {!Lwt.return}[ ()] anyway.

    In future Lwt, we hope to perform this optimization, of using a single,
    pre-allocated promise, automatically, wherever {!Lwt.return}[ ()] is
    written. *)

val return_none : (_ option) t
(** [Lwt.return_none] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for
    {!Lwt.return}[ None]. *)

val return_nil : (_ list) t
(** [Lwt.return_nil] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for {!Lwt.return}[ []]. *)

val return_true : bool t
(** [Lwt.return_true] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for
    {!Lwt.return}[ true]. *)

val return_false : bool t
(** [Lwt.return_false] is like {!Lwt.return_unit}, but for
    {!Lwt.return}[ false]. *)

(** We omit state introspection because it is discouraged when not defining new
    synchronisation primitives which the protocol doesn't do. *)

val return_some : 'a -> ('a option) t
(** Counterpart to {!Lwt.return_none}. However, unlike {!Lwt.return_none}, this
    function performs no {{: #VALreturn_unit} optimization}. This is because it
    takes an argument, so it cannot be evaluated at initialization time, at
    which time the argument is not yet available. *)

val return_ok : 'a -> (('a, _) result) t
(** Like {!Lwt.return_some}, this function performs no optimization.

    @since Lwt 2.6.0 *)

val return_error : 'e -> ((_, 'e) result) t
(** Like {!Lwt.return_some}, this function performs no optimization.

    @since Lwt 2.6.0 *)

(** Create a single encoding from a series of cases.

    In JSON, all cases are tried one after the other using the [case list]. The
    caller is responsible for avoiding collisions. If there are collisions
    (i.e., if multiple cases produce the same JSON output) then the encoding
    and decoding processes might not be inverse of each other. In other words,
    [destruct e (construct e v)] may not be equal to [v].

    In binary, a prefix tag is added to discriminate quickly between
    cases. The default is [`Uint8] and you must use a [`Uint16] if
    you are going to have more than 256 cases.

    The matching function is used during binary encoding of a value
    [v] to efficiently determine which of the cases corresponds to
    [v]. The case list is used during decoding to reconstruct a value based on
    the encoded tag. (Decoding is optimised internally: tag look-up has a
    constant cost.)

    The caller is responsible for ensuring that the [matching_function] and the
    [case list] describe the same encoding. If they describe different
    encodings, then the decoding and encoding processes will not be inverses of
    each others. In other words, [of_bytes e (to_bytes e v)] will not be equal
    to [v].

    If you do not wish to be responsible for this, you can use the unoptimised
    {!union} that uses a [case list] only (see below). Beware that in {!union}
    the complexity of the encoding is linear in the number of cases.

      because when encoding we have access to the list and we can check the
      actual length, whereas when decoding we only see bytes, sometimes too
      many, sometimes not enough.

      This encoding has a narrow set of possible applications because it is
      very restrictive. Still, it can to:
      - mirror static guarantees about the length of some lists,
      - special-case some common lengths of typical input in a union (see
        example below),
      - other ends.

{[
type expr =
  | Op of string * expr list (* most commonly 1 or 2 operands *)
  | Literal of string
let expr_encoding =
  mu "expr" (fun e ->
    union [
      case ~title:"op-nonary" (Tag 0)
        string
        (function Op (op, []) -> Some op | _ -> None)
        (fun op -> Op (op, []));
      case ~title:"op-unary" (Tag 1)
        (tup2 string (Fixed.list 1 e))
        (function Op (op, ([_]) as operand) -> Some (op, operand) | _ -> None)
        (fun (op, operand) -> Op (op, operand));
      case ~title:"op-binary" (Tag 2)
        (tup2 string (Fixed.list 2 e))
        (function Op (op, ([_;_]) as operand) -> Some (op, operand) | _ -> None)
        (fun (op, operand) -> Op (op, operand));
      case ~title:"op-moreary" (Tag 3)
        (tup2 string (list e))

module Compact : sig
  (** This module provides specialized encoding combinators that are
      implemented to reduce the size of the serialization result.

      The main trick this module relies on is the notion of “shared tags”.
      In [Data_encoding], the [union] combinator uses (at least) one byte
      every time it is used, to “tag” the output and distinguish between
      various disjunction cases. As a consequence, if [n] [union] are
      composed together to define one encoding, (at least) [n] bytes are
      being allocated. However, in practice, only few bits are used in
      each tags, which means the rest is “wasted.”

      As an example, consider this type:

      {[
      type t =
        | T1 of { f1 : int option; f2 : (int, bool) Either.t }
        | T2 of { f3: int }
      ]}

      A value of [t] using the constructor [T1] will be serialized into
      a binary array of this form:

      {v
      ┌────────┬─────────┬─────────────┬─────────┬─────────────┐
      │ tag(t) │ tag(f1) │ payload(f1) │ tag(f2) │ payload(f2) │
      └────────┴─────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴─────────────┘
        1 byte   1 byte    N bytes       1 byte    M bytes
      v}

      Where [tag(f)] is a value used by [Data_encoding] to distinguish
      between several encoding alternatives for [f], and [payload(f)] is
      the resulting binary array.

      For both [option] and [Either.t], the tag of the encoding only uses
      one bit in practice. Which means that for [T1], encoding the pair
      [(f1, f2)] needs two bits, but the default approach of
      [Data_encoding] uses two {i bytes} instead.  Similarly, to
      distinguish between [T1] and [T2] needs one bit, but the default
      approach is to use an additional tag (one additional {i byte}).

      This module provides an approach to tackle this issue, by
      allocating only one tag ({i i.e.}, one byte) that is used to store
      the useful bits to distinguish between the disjunction cases. We
      call this tag the “shared tag” of the encoding. The bits of the
      shared tag describes precisely the layout of the encoded data.

      For instance, considering a compact encoding for [t], the third
      bit of the tag can be used to distinguish between [T1] and [T2].
      In case the third bit is 0, the first bit of the tag determines
      the case of [option], and the second the case of [Either.t].

      As a consequence the resulting binary array for the constructor
      [T1] is, using
      - [_] to represent meaningless bits,
      - [0] and [1] to represent actual bit values,
      - [e] to represent the bit used to distinguish the [Either] case of [f2], and
      - [o] to represent the bit used to distinguish the [Option] case of [f1]:

      {v
      ┌──────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
      │ _____0eo │ payload(f1) │ payload(f2) │
      └──────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
        1 byte     N bytes       M bytes
      v}

      while the resulting binary array for the constructor [T2] is

      {v
      ┌──────────┬─────────────┐
      │ _____100 │ payload(f3) │
      └──────────┴─────────────┘
        1 byte     N bytes
      v} *)

      Note that the compact union can be combined with more compact encoding
      before being passed to [make] in which case the two bits of tags will be
      combined with the tags of the other compact encodings. E.g.,
      [make ~tag_size:`Uint8 (tup2 c c)].

      @param union_tag_bits is the number of bits used to distinguish the
      different cases of the union. For example, if the union has 4 cases
      (i.e., if [List.length cases = 4]) then you can use [~union_tag_bits:2].

      If not provided explicitly, [union_tag_bits] is inferred: it is set to
      the smallest value which can accommodate the provided [cases].

      It is recommended to set [union_tag_bits] explicitly.

      You can over-provision the [union_tag_bits] if you expect the
      [cases] to grow in the future.

      @raise Invalid_argument if the value passed for [union_tag_bits] is not
      sufficient to distinguish between the [cases].

      @param cases_tag_bits is the number of bits that each of the [cases] can
      use. This is only useful if the cases use more than 0 bits of tag.

      It is recommended to set [cases_tag_bits] explicitly if you need the
      layout to be stable even if the [cases] or one of its element changes.

      You can over-provision the [cases_tag_bits] if you expect one of the
      cases to change to use more bits of tag or if you expect that a new case
      using more tag bits will be added in the future.

      E.g., passing [~cases_tag_bits:7] to the [union] in the example above
      will cause the values to be represented as follows:
      - 0b00000000: case [A], [false]
      - 0b00000001: case [A], [true]
      - 0b10000000: case [B], [Some] (a payload of 4 bytes follows)
      - 0b10000001: case [B], [None]

      @raise Invalid_argument if one of the elements of [cases] needs more
      than [cases_tag_bits] bits of tag.

      E.g., [union ~cases_tag_bits:0 [case "Bool" Option.some Fun.id bool]]
      raises [Invalid_argument] because {!bool} uses one bit of tag which is
      more than [0].

      @raise Invalid_argument if [cases] is empty. *)

  (** [void_case ~title] is an impossible case. It is provided so you can add
      unused tags within a union. E.g.,
      [union [case _; void_case ~title:"reserved-for-v04-compatibility"; case _; case _]]
      uses two bits of tag for the discrimination of the union,
      but the tag [01] is unused (reserved for some version compatibility). *)

   This module provides support for type equalities and runtime type identifiers.

   For two types [a] and [b], [(a, b) eq] is a witness that [a = b]. This is
   a standard generalized algebraic datatype on top of which type-level
   programming techniques can be implemented.

   Given a type [a], an inhabitant of [a t] is a dynamic identifier for [a].
   Identifiers can be compared for equality. They are also equipped with a
   hash function.

   WARNING: the hash function changes at every run. Therefore, the result
   of the hash function should never be stored.

   Notice that dynamic identifiers are not unique: two identifiers for [a]
   can have distinct hash and can be physically distinct. Hence, only [eq]
   can decide if two type identifiers correspond to the same type.

*)

(** [make ()] is a dynamic representation for ['a]. A fresh identifier
   is returned each time [make ()] is evaluated. *)

(** {1 List}

    A replacement for {!Stdlib.List} which:
    - replaces the exception-raising functions by exception-safe variants,
    - provides Lwt-, result- and Lwt-result-aware traversors.

    [List] is intended to shadow both {!Stdlib.List} and {!Lwt_list}. *)

(** {2 Basics}

    Checkout {!Lwtreslib} for an introduction to the naming and semantic
    convention of Lwtreslib. In a nutshell:
    - Stdlib functions that raise exceptions are replaced by safe variants
      (typically returning [option]).
    - The [_e] suffix is for result-aware traversors ("e" stands for "error"),
      [_s] and [_p] are for Lwt-aware, and [_es] and [_ep] are for
      Lwt-result-aware.
    - [_e], [_s], and [_es] traversors are {i fail-early}: they stop traversal
      as soon as a failure ([Error] or [Fail]) occurs; [_p] and [_ep]
      traversors are {i best-effort}: they only resolve once all of the
      intermediate promises have, even if a failure occurs. *)

(** {2 Double-traversal and combine}

    Note that double-list traversors ([iter2], [map2], etc., and also [combine])
    take an additional [when_different_lengths] parameter. This is to control
    the error that is returned when the two lists passed as arguments have
    different lengths.

    This mechanism is a replacement for {!Stdlib.List.iter2} (etc.) raising
    [Invalid_argument].

    Note that, as per the fail-early behaviour mentioned above, [_e], [_s], and
    [_es] traversors will have already processed the common-prefix before the
    error is returned.

    Because the best-effort behaviour of [_p] and [_ep] is unsatisfying for this
    failure case, double parallel traversors are omitted from this library.
    (Specifically, it is not obvious whether nor how the
    [when_different_lengths] error should be composed with the other errors.)

    To obtain a different behaviour for sequential traversors, or to process
    two lists in parallel, you can use {!combine} or any of the alternatives
    that handles the error differently: {!combine_drop},
    {!combine_with_leftovers}. Finally, the {!rev_combine} is provided to allow
    to avoid multiple-reversing.

    {3 Special considerations}

    Because they traverse the list from right-to-left, the {!fold_right2}
    function and all its variants fail with [when_different_lengths] before any
    of the processing starts. Whilst this is still within the fail-early
    behaviour, it may be surprising enough that it requires mentioning here.

    Because they may return early, {!for_all2} and {!exists2} and all their
    variants may return [Ok _] even though the arguments have different lengths.

    This part of the module simply shadows some functions from {!Stdlib.List}
    with exceptionless variants. As per the design principles of Lwtreslib,

      unavailability of data return an [option] instead,
    - function which may fail with [Invalid_argument _] or otherwise from
      malformedness of input receive an additional parameter to return as an
      [Error] instead,
    - functions which perform polymorphic comparison receive an additional
      parameter for monomorphic comparison instead. *)

    simply replace [append xs ys] with [rev_append xs ys].

    Second, you can use [rev_append] on an already reversed list. You may
    obtain an already reversed list from any of the other [rev_*] functions of
    this module, or simply via your own traversal. In this case, you replace,
    say, [append (map f xs) ys] with [rev_append (rev_map f xs) ys]. *)

(** {3 Double-list traversals}

    These safe-wrappers take an explicit value to handle the case of lists of
    unequal length. This value is passed as a named parameter:
    [when_different_lengths].

    Note that the traversal function passed as argument (if any) is applied to
    the common prefix of the two lists, even if they are of different lengths.
    E.g., in [map2 f ['x', 'y'] ['a']] the call [f 'x' 'a'] is made and all
    its side-effects are performed before the value
    [Error when_different_lengths] is returned

(** [combine ~when_different_lengths l1 l2] is either
    - [Error when_different_lengths] if [List.length l1 <> List.length l2]
    - a list of pairs of elements from [l1] and [l2]

      E.g., [combine ~when_different_lengths [] []] is [Ok []]

      E.g., [combine ~when_different_lengths [1; 2] ['a'; 'b']] is [Ok [(1,'a'); (2, 'b')]]

      E.g., [combine ~when_different_lengths:"wrong" [1] []] is [Error "wrong"]

    Note: [combine ~when_different_lengths l1 l2] is equivalent to
      [try Ok (Stdlib.List.combine l1 l2) with Invalid_argument _ -> when_different_lengths]

    The same equivalence almost holds for the other double traversors below.
    The notable difference is if the functions passed as argument to the
    traversors raise the [Invalid_argument _] exception. *)

    Remember that, even if the lists are of different lengths, the function
    [f] is applied to the common prefix of [xs] and [ys]. This is true for
    other traversals, but especially relevant to [iter] which is commonly used

    [f x0 y0 && f x1 y1 && …].

    The function stops early if it encounters elements [xn], [yn] such that [f

    evaluation strategy of [&&] in the description above.)

    Also note that, if such an element is found in the common prefix of [xs]
    and [ys], then the function returns [Ok false] even if [xs] and [ys] are
    of different lengths.

    Examples:

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['a']] is [Ok false]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['a']] is [Ok false]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['x']] is [Ok true]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['x'; 'b']] is [Ok false]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['x'; 'y'; 'c']] is

    evaluation strategy of [||] in the description above.)

    Also note that, if such an element is found in the common prefix of [xs]
    and [ys], then the function returns [Ok true] even if [xs] and [ys] are of
    different lengths.

    Examples:

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) [] []] is [Ok false]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['a']] is [Ok false]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['a']] is [Error when_different_lengths]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['x']] is [Ok true]

(* This Array module is the thinnest shim we can get away with for use with Plonk.
   To avoid any issues with arrays — notably to avoid exceptions when getting
   out of bounds and to avoid any issues with mutability — we shadow [get] and
   [set] as well as a few other functions.

   Note that we do not shadow every other function. E.g., [of_list]. This is
   because those functions might be added later. We only shadow functions which
   may cause serious issues. *)

    is [true] are caught.

    Whether [catch_only] is set or not, you cannot catch non-deterministic

    In other words, it catches exceptions in [f ()] and either returns the
    value in an [Ok] or passes the exception to [handler] for the [Error].

    [catch_only] has the same use as with [catch]. The same restriction on
    catching non-deterministic runtime exceptions applies. *)

    [x], or to [Error exc] if and when [f ()] is rejected with [exc].

        [f t']. Once done, it compares [t']'s hash and [f t']'s hash to [before]
        and [after]. If they match, they know that the result state [f t'] is a

      These proofs encode large directories into a tree-like structure. This
      reflects irmin-pack's way of representing nodes and computing
      hashes (tree-like representations for nodes scales better than flat
      representations).

      [length] is the total number of entries in the children of the inode.
      It's the size of the "flattened" version of that inode. [length] can be
      used to prove the correctness of operations such [Tree.length] and
      [Tree.list ~offset ~length] in an efficient way.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = false], an inode at depth 0 has a
      [length] of at least [257]. Below that threshold a [Node] tag is used in
      [tree]. That threshold is [3] when [version.is_binary = true].

      [proofs] contains the children proofs. It is a sparse list of ['a] values.
      These values are associated to their index in the list, and the list is
      kept sorted in increasing order of indices. ['a] can be a concrete proof
      or a hash of that proof.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = true], inodes have at most 2 proofs
      (indexed 0 or 1).

      An extender is a compact representation of a sequence of [inode] which

      concrete proof or a hash of that proof.

      If an inode proof contains singleton children [i_0, ..., i_n] such as:
      [{length=l; proofs = [ (i_0, {proofs = ... { proofs = [ (i_n, p) ] }})]}],
      then it is compressed into the inode extender

      Tree proofs do not provide any guarantee with the ordering of

      distinguishable by this kind of proofs.

      [Value v] proves that a value [v] exists in the store.

      [Blinded_value h] proves a value with hash [h] exists in the store.

      [Node ls] proves that a a "flat" node containing the list of files [ls]
      exists in the store.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = true], the length of [ls] is at most
      2.

      In proofs with [version.is_binary = false], the length of [ls] is at most
      256.

      [Blinded_node h] proves that a node with hash [h] exists in the store.

    (** Stream proofs represent an explicit traversal of a Merle tree proof.
        Every element (a node, a value, or a shallow pointer) met is first
        "compressed" by shallowing its children and then recorded in the proof.

        As stream proofs directly encode the recursive construction of the
        Merkle root hash is slightly simpler to implement: verifier simply
        need to hash the compressed elements lazily, without any memory or
        choice.

        Moreover, the minimality of stream proofs is trivial to check.
        Once the computation has consumed the compressed elements required,
        it is sufficient to check that no more compressed elements remain
        in the proof.

        However, as the compressed elements contain all the hashes of their
        shallow children, the size of stream proofs is larger
        (at least double in size in practice) than tree proofs, which only
        contains the hash for intermediate shallow pointers. *)

    tree as input and returns a new version of the tree and a result. [p] is a
    proof, that is a minimal representation of the tree that contains what [f]
    should be expecting.

    Therefore, contrary to trees found in a storage, the contents of the trees
    passed to [f] may not be available. For this reason, looking up a value at
    some [path] can now produce three distinct outcomes:
    - A value [v] is present in the proof [p] and returned : [find tree path]
      is a promise returning [Some v];
    - [path] is known to have no value in [tree] : [find tree path] is a
      promise returning [None]; and
    - [path] is known to have a value in [tree] but [p] does not provide it
      because [f] should not need it: [verify] returns an error classifying
      [path] as an invalid path (see below).

    The same semantics apply to all operations on the tree [t] passed to [f]
    and on all operations on the trees built from [f].

    The generated tree is the tree after [f] has completed. That tree is
    disconnected from any storage (i.e. [index]). It is possible to run
    operations on it as long as they don't require loading shallowed subtrees.

  (** {2 Block (and operation) validation and application}

      The following functions may be used when an existing block is
      received through the network, when a new block is created, or
      when operations are considered on their own e.g. in a mempool or
      during an RPC call.

      Validation aims at deciding quickly whether a block or
      an operation is valid, with minimal computations and without
      writing anything in the storage. A block is valid if it can be
      applied without failure. An operation is valid if it can be
      safely included in a block without causing it to fail.

      The application of an operation updates the {!Context.t} with
      regards to its semantics (e.g. updating balances after a
      transaction). The application of a block updates the context
      with all its operations and some additional global
      effects. Isolated operations may be applied as part of an RPC
      call to simulate their effects.

      Blocks and operations must always be validated before they are
      applied. Indeed, the application assumes their validity as a
      precondition, meaning that the application of an invalid block
      might yield incorrect results instead of failing cleanly.

      Note that in protocol versions <= K, where the validation
      functions do not yet exist, the validation of existing blocks is
      done by trying to apply it using the [Partial_validation] mode
      below. Therefore, the application of a validated block may still
      fail in these protocols. *)

  (** The mode indicates the circumstances in which a block and/or
      operations are validated or applied, and contains specific
      information. It must be provided as an argument to
      [begin_validation] and [begin_application]. *)
  type mode =
    | Application of block_header
        (** Standard validation or application of a preexisting block. *)
    | Partial_validation of block_header
        (** Partial validation of a preexisting block. This mode is
            meant to quickly reject obviously invalid alternate
            branches by only performing a subset of checks.
            Therefore, application of blocks or operations makes no
            sense in this mode: calling [begin_application] with this
            mode returns an error. *)
    | Construction of {
        predecessor_hash : Block_hash.t;
        timestamp : Time.t;
        block_header_data : block_header_data;
      }
        (** Construction of a new block. The main difference with the
            previous modes is that we cannot provide the block header to the
            [begin_] functions, since the block does not exist yet. Note that
            the [begin_] functions may be called in this mode without knowing
            yet which operations will be included in the future block.

            The provided [block_header_data] is not expected to be the final
            value of the field of the same type in the {!type-block_header} of
            the constructed block. Instead, it should be a protocol-specific,
            good enough, "prototype" of the final value. E.g. if the
            {!block_header_data} type for the current economic protocol includes
            a signature, then the provided [block_header_data] should contain a
            fake signature (since providing a correct signature is not possible
            at this stage). *)

            suited for this) or by some RPCs

            no sense in this mode. *)

      [predecessor_context] and [predecessor] are the resulting
      context and shell header of the predecessor block. Exceptionally
      in {!Partial_validation} mode, they may instead come from any
      ancestor block that is more recent (i.e. has a greater level)
      than the current head's "last_allowed_fork_level".

      [mode] specifies the circumstances of validation and also
      carries additional information: see {!mode}.

      Note that for protocol versions <= K where [begin_validation]
      does not exist yet, this calls the old [begin_application] by
      necessity. However, in [Application] mode, this calls the old
      [begin_application] in [Partial_validation] mode in order to run
      more quickly. This preserves the behavior of [precheck] in
      [lib_validation/block_validation.ml] for old protocols. It does

(**
  aPlonK is a {e PlonK}-based proving system.
  As such, it provides a way to create {e succinct cryptographic proofs}
  about a given predicate, which can be then verified with a low
  computational cost.

  In this system, a predicate is represented by an {e arithmetic circuit},
  i.e. a collection of arithmetic {e gates} operating over a {e prime field},
  connected through {e wires} holding {e scalars} from this field.
  For example, the following diagram illustrates a simple circuit checking that
  the addition of two scalars ([w1] and [w2]) is equal to [w0]. Here,
  the [add] gate can be seen as taking two inputs and producing an output,
  while the [eq] gate just takes two inputs and asserts they're equal.

{[
          (w0)│      w1│         w2│
              │        └───┐   ┌───┘
              │          ┌─┴───┴─┐
              │          │  add  │
              │          └───┬───┘
              └──────┐   ┌───┘w3
                   ┌─┴───┴─┐
                   │  eq   │
                   └───────┘
]}

  The wires of a circuit are called {e prover inputs}, since the prover needs
  an assignment of all wires to produce a proof.
  The predicate also declares a subset of the wires called {e verifier inputs}.
  In our example, wire [w0] is the only verifier input, which is
  indicated by the parenthesis.
  A proof for a given [w0] would prove the following statement:
    [∃ w1, w2, w3: w3 = w1 + w2 ∧ w0 = w3]
  This means that the verifier only needs a (typically small) subset of the
  inputs alongside the (succinct) proof to check the validity of the statement.

  A more interesting example would be to replace the [add] gate
  by a more complicated hash circuit. This would prove the knowledge of the
  pre-image of a hash.

  A simplified view of aPlonk's API consists of the following three functions:
{[
    val setup : circuit -> srs ->
      (prover_public_parameters, verifier_public_parameters)

    val prove : prover_public_parameters -> prover_inputs ->
      private_inputs -> proof

    val verify : verifier_public_parameters -> verifier_inputs ->
      proof -> bool
]}

  In addition to the prove and verify, the interface provides a function
  to setup the system. The setup function requires a {e Structured Reference String}.
  Two large SRSs were generated by the ZCash and Filecoin
  projects and are both used in aPlonK.
  Notice also that the circuit is used during setup only and, independently
  from its size, the resulting {e verifier_public_parameters} will be a
  succinct piece of data that will be posted on-chain to allow
  verification and they are bound to the specific circuit that generated
  them.
  The {e prover_public_parameters}'s size is linear in the size of the circuit.

(** A skip list represents a sequence of values. There are three main
    differences between these [skip list]s and OCaml standard [list]s:

    1. A skip list cannot be empty.

    2. A skip list grows at its end.

    3. Each cell of the skip list provides several back pointers
       allowing to *skip* chunk of ancestors of the sequence to directly
       jump to a given position. More precisely, given a [basis]
       parameter, the i-th back pointers of element number [n] in the
       sequence points to [n - n mod basis^i - 1].  The element number [n]
       in the sequence contains [log_basis n] back pointers.

    The skip list is defined by a pair of dereferencing function
    of type ['ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell] and the last cell
    of the sequence. The maintainance of this pair is left to the client.
    In particular, the client is responsible to correctly bind a cell
    to each back pointers reachable from the last cell.

     list according to its content. This function assumes that the
     content of the cells is in increasing order according to the
     ordering defined by the function [compare]. In other words, this
     function assumes that [compare] is a function that returns a
     negative integer for cells before the target and a positive
     integer for cells after the target. The value returned by this
     function is [{rev_path; last_cell}] such that.

     cell [B], [rev_path] contains the list of cells to go from [B] to
     [A]. Consequently, the first element of [rev_path] is [B].
     Except for [Nearest_lower], this path is a minimal path.

     - [last_pointer = Deref_returned_none] if [deref] fails to
     associate a cell to a pointer during the search. In that case,
     [rev_path] is a path from [cell] to [candidate] where [candidate]
     is the last cell for which candidate did not fail and such that
     [compare (content (candidate)) > 0].

     - [last_pointer = No_exact_or_lower_ptr] if for all cell of the
     skip list, [compare (content cell) > 0]. In that case, [rev_path]
     is a path from [cell] to the genesis cell.

     - [last_pointer = Found target] if there is a cell [target] such
     that [compare (content target) = 0] and a path from [cell] to
     [target]. In that case, [rev_path] is the minimal path from
     [cell] to [target].

     - [last_pointer = Nearest_lower {lower;upper}] if there is no
     cell in the skip list such that [compare (content cell) = 0]. In
     that case [lower] is the unique cell such that [compare (content
     lower) < 0] and for all other cells [candidate] such that
     [compare (content candidate) < 0] then there is a path from
     [lower] to [candidate]. [upper], if it exists is the successor
     cell to [lower], i.e. [deref ((back_pointer upper) 0) = Some
     lower].  In that case, [rev_path] is a path from [cell] to
     [lower]. This path is *NOT* minimal but almost. The path is
     minimal from [cell] to [upper=Some up]. By minimality, the path
     is logarithmic. Consequently, since there is a direct pointer
     from [up] to [lower], the passe to [lower] is also
     logarithmic. *)
