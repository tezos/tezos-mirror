(** {1 List}

    A replacement for {!Stdlib.List} which:
    - replaces the exception-raising functions by exception-safe variants,
    - provides Lwt-, result- and Lwt-result-aware traversors.

    [List] is intended to shadow both {!Stdlib.List} and {!Lwt_list}. *)

(** {2 Basics}

    Checkout {!Lwtreslib} for an introduction to the naming and semantic
    convention of Lwtreslib. In a nutshell:
    - Stdlib functions that raise exceptions are replaced by safe variants
      (typically returning [option]).
    - The [_e] suffix is for result-aware traversors ("e" stands for "error"),
      [_s] and [_p] are for Lwt-aware, and [_es] and [_ep] are for
      Lwt-result-aware.
    - [_e], [_s], and [_es] traversors are {i fail-early}: they stop traversal
      as soon as a failure ([Error] or [Fail]) occurs; [_p] and [_ep]
      traversors are {i best-effort}: they only resolve once all of the
      intermediate promises have, even if a failure occurs. *)

(** {2 Double-traversal and combine}

    Note that double-list traversors ([iter2], [map2], etc., and also [combine])
    take an additional [when_different_lengths] parameter. This is to control
    the error that is returned when the two lists passed as arguments have
    different lengths.

    This mechanism is a replacement for {!Stdlib.List.iter2} (etc.) raising
    [Invalid_argument].

    Note that, as per the fail-early behaviour mentioned above, [_e], [_s], and
    [_es] traversors will have already processed the common-prefix before the
    error is returned.

    Because the best-effort behaviour of [_p] and [_ep] is unsatisfying for this
    failure case, double parallel traversors are omitted from this library.
    (Specifically, it is not obvious whether nor how the
    [when_different_lengths] error should be composed with the other errors.)

    To obtain a different behaviour for sequential traversors, or to process
    two lists in parallel, you can use {!combine} or any of the alternatives
    that handles the error differently: {!combine_drop},
    {!combine_with_leftovers}. Finally, the {!rev_combine} is provided to allow
    to avoid multiple-reversing.

    {3 Special considerations}

    Because they traverse the list from right-to-left, the {!fold_right2}
    function and all its variants fail with [when_different_lengths] before any
    of the processing starts. Whilst this is still within the fail-early
    behaviour, it may be surprising enough that it requires mentioning here.

    Because they may return early, {!for_all2} and {!exists2} and all their
    variants may return [Ok _] even though the arguments have different lengths.

(** {3 Safe wrappers}

    This part of the module simply shadows some functions from {!Stdlib.List}
    with exceptionless variants. As per the design principles of Lwtreslib,

    - functions which may fail with [Not_found] or otherwise from
      unavailability of data return an [option] instead,
    - function which may fail with [Invalid_argument _] or otherwise from
      malformedness of input receive an additional parameter to return as an
      [Error] instead,
    - functions which perform polymorphic comparison receive an additional
      parameter for monomorphic comparison instead. *)

(** [hd xs] is the head (first element) of the list or [None] if the list is
    empty. *)
val hd : 'a list -> 'a option

(** [tl xs] is the tail of the list (the whole list except the first element)
    or [None] if the list is empty. *)
val tl : 'a list -> 'a list option

(** [nth xs n] is the [n]th element of the list or [None] if the list has
    fewer than [n] elements.

    For example, [nth xs 0 = hd xs] and [nth ['x'; 'y'] 1 = Some 'y']. *)
val nth : 'a list -> int -> 'a option

(** [nth_opt] is an alias for [nth] provided for compatibility with

val nth_opt : 'a list -> int -> 'a option

(** [last x xs] is the last element of the list [xs] or [x] if [xs] is empty.

    The primary intended use for [last] is after destructing a list:
      [match l with | [] -> â€¦ | x :: xs -> last x xs]
    but it can also be used for a default value:
    [last default_value_if_empty xs]. *)
val last : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a

(** [last_opt xs] is the last element of the list [xs] or [None] if the list

(** [find_map f xs] applies [f] to each of the elements of [xs] until it
    returns [Some _] at which point it is returned. If no such elements are
    found then it returns [None].

    Note that it only applies [f] to a prefix of [xs]. It doesn't apply [f] to
    the elements of [xs] which are after the found element. Consequently,
    [find_map f xs] has better performance and a different semantic than
    calling [map] and [find] separately. *)
val find_map : ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a list -> 'b option

val mem_assoc : equal:('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> bool

(** [mem_assq k l] is [mem_assoc ~equal:Stdlib.( == ) k l]. *)
val mem_assq : 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> bool

(** [remove_assoc ~equal k l] is [l] without the first element [(k', _)] such
    that [equal k k']. *)
val remove_assoc :
  equal:('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a * 'b) list

(** [remove_assoq k l] is [remove_assoc ~equal:Stdlib.( == ) k l]. *)
val remove_assq : 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a * 'b) list

(** {3 Initialisation} *)

(** [init ~when_negative_length n f] is a list of [n] elements [f 0], [f 1],
    etc.

    If [n] is negative, it is [Error when_negative_length] instead. *)
val init :
  when_negative_length:'trace ->
  int ->
  (int -> 'a) ->
  ('a list, 'trace) result

(** {3 Basic traversal} *)

(** [length xs] is the number of elements in [xs].

    [length []] is [0], [length ['x']] is [1], etc. *)
val length : 'a list -> int

(** [rev xs] is a list with the elements appearing in the reverse order as in
    [xs].

    [rev ['x'; 'y']] is ['y'; 'x'] *)
val rev : 'a list -> 'a list

(** [concat xs] is a list containing the elements of the elements of [xs].

    [concat [['x'; 'y']; ['a'; 'b']]] is [['x'; 'y'; 'a'; 'b']] *)
val concat : 'a list list -> 'a list

(** [append xs ys] is a list containing the elements of [xs] and the elements
    of [ys], in this order.

    [concat ['x'; 'y'] ['a'; 'b']] is [['x'; 'y'; 'a'; 'b']] *)
val append : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list

(** [rev_append xs ys] is [append (rev xs) ys] but more efficient. In other
    words, [rev_append xs ys] is a list containing the elements of xs in
    reverse order followed by the elements of [ys].

    There are two main use-cases for [rev_append]. First, you should use
    [rev_append] when the order of elements is unimportant. In this case you
    simply replace [append xs ys] with [rev_append xs ys].

    Second, you can use [rev_append] on an already reversed list. You may
    obtain an already reversed list from any of the other [rev_*] functions of
    this module, or simply via your own traversal. In this case, you replace,
    say, [append (map f xs) ys] with [rev_append (rev_map f xs) ys]. *)
val rev_append : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list

  (** [flatten] is an alias for {!concat}. *)
val flatten : 'a list list -> 'a list

(** {3 Double-list traversals}

    These safe-wrappers take an explicit value to handle the case of lists of
    unequal length. This value is passed as a named parameter:
    [when_different_lengths].

    Note that the traversal function passed as argument (if any) is applied to
    the common prefix of the two lists, even if they are of different lengths.
    E.g., in [map2 f ['x', 'y'] ['a']] the call [f 'x' 'a'] is made and all
    its side-effects are performed before the value
    [Error when_different_lengths] is returned
*)

(** [combine ~when_different_lengths l1 l2] is either
    - [Error when_different_lengths] if [List.length l1 <> List.length l2]
    - a list of pairs of elements from [l1] and [l2]

      E.g., [combine ~when_different_lengths [] []] is [Ok []]

      E.g., [combine ~when_different_lengths [1; 2] ['a'; 'b']] is [Ok [(1,'a'); (2, 'b')]]

      E.g., [combine ~when_different_lengths:"wrong" [1] []] is [Error "wrong"]

    Note: [combine ~when_different_lengths l1 l2] is equivalent to
      [try Ok (Stdlib.List.combine l1 l2) with Invalid_argument _ -> when_different_lengths]

    The same equivalence almost holds for the other double traversors below.
    The notable difference is if the functions passed as argument to the
    traversors raise the [Invalid_argument _] exception. *)
val combine :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  (('a * 'b) list, 'trace) result

(** [rev_combine ~when_different_lengths xs ys] is
    [rev (combine ~when_different_lengths xs ys)] but more efficient. *)
val rev_combine :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  (('a * 'b) list, 'trace) result

(** [split xs] is [(List.map fst xs, List.map snd xs)] but more efficient. *)
val split : ('a * 'b) list -> 'a list * 'b list

(** [iter2 ~when_different_lengths f xs ys] is [f x0 y0; f x1 y1; â€¦].

    Remember that, even if the lists are of different lengths, the function
    [f] is applied to the common prefix of [xs] and [ys]. This is true for
    other traversals, but especially relevant to [iter] which is commonly used
    for side-effects. *)
val iter2 :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  ('a -> 'b -> unit) ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  (unit, 'trace) result

(** [map2 ~when_different_lengths f xs ys] is a list with elements [f x0 y0],
    [f x1 y1], etc.

    Remember that, even if the lists are of different lengths, the function
    [f] is applied to the common prefix of [xs] and [ys]. Beware of
    side-effects and computational cost. *)
val map2 :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  ('a -> 'b -> 'c) ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  ('c list, 'trace) result

(** [rev_map2 ~when_different_lengths f xs ys] is
    [Result.map rev @@ map2 ~when_different_lengths f xs ys] but more
    efficient.

    Remember that, even if the lists are of different lengths, the function
    [f] is applied to the common prefix of [xs] and [ys]. Beware of
    side-effects and computational cost. *)
val rev_map2 :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  ('a -> 'b -> 'c) ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  ('c list, 'trace) result

(** [fold_left2 ~when_different_lengths f init xs ys] is
    [â€¦ (f (f init x0 y0) x1 y1)].

    Remember that, even if the lists are of different lengths, the function
    [f] is applied to the common prefix of [xs] and [ys]. Beware of
    side-effects and computational cost. *)
val fold_left2 :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  ('a -> 'b -> 'c -> 'a) ->
  'a ->
  'b list ->
  'c list ->
  ('a, 'trace) result

(** [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths f xs ys] is
    [f x0 y0 && f x1 y1 && â€¦].

    The function stops early if it encounters elements [xn], [yn] such that [f
    xn yn] is [false]. (This is consistent with the short-circuit, lazy
    evaluation strategy of [&&] in the description above.)

    Also note that, if such an element is found in the common prefix of [xs]
    and [ys], then the function returns [Ok false] even if [xs] and [ys] are
    of different lengths.

    Examples:

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) [] []] is [Ok true]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['a']] is [Ok false]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['a']] is [Ok false]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['x']] is [Ok true]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['x']] is [Error when_different_lengths]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['x'; 'b']] is [Ok false]

    [for_all2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['x'; 'y'; 'c']] is
    [Error when_different_lengths]

    Remember that, when it returns [Error when_different_lengths], the
    function [f] has already been applied to the common prefix of [xs] and
    [ys]. Beware of side-effects and computational cost. *)
val for_all2 :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  ('a -> 'b -> bool) ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  (bool, 'trace) result

(** [exists2 ~when_different_lengths f xs ys] is
    [f x0 y0 || f x1 y1 || â€¦].

    The function stops early if it encounters elements [xn], [yn] such that [f
    xn yn] is [true]. (This is consistent with the short-circuit, lazy
    evaluation strategy of [||] in the description above.)

    Also note that, if such an element is found in the common prefix of [xs]
    and [ys], then the function returns [Ok true] even if [xs] and [ys] are of
    different lengths.

    Examples:

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) [] []] is [Ok false]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['a']] is [Ok false]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['a']] is [Error when_different_lengths]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'] ['x']] is [Ok true]

    [exists2 ~when_different_lengths (=) ['x'; 'y'] ['x']] is [Ok true]

    Remember that, when it returns [Error when_different_lengths], the
    function [f] has already been applied to the common prefix of [xs] and
    [ys]. Beware of side-effects and computational cost. *)
val exists2 :
  when_different_lengths:'trace ->
  ('a -> 'b -> bool) ->
  'a list ->
  'b list ->
  (bool, 'trace) result

(** {3 Monad-aware variants}

    The functions below are strict extensions of the standard {!Stdlib.List}
    module. It is for result-, lwt- and lwt-result-aware variants. The meaning
    of the suffix is as described above, in {!Lwtreslib}, and in {!Sigs.Seq}. *)

(** {3 Initialisation variants}

    Note that for asynchronous variants ([_s], [_es], [_p], and [_ep]), if the
    length parameter is negative, then the promise is returned already
    fulfilled with [Error when_different_lengths]. *)

(** [init_p] is a variant of {!init_s} where the promises are evaluated
    concurrently. *)

(** [product xs ys] is the cartesian product of [xs] and [ys].

    In other words [product xs ys] is a list containing all the pairs [(x, y)]
    where [x] is an element of [xs] and [y] is an element of [ys].

    The order of the elements in the returned list is unspecified. *)
