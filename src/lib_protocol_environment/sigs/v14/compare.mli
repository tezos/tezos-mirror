(** {1 [Compare]}

    Monomorphic comparison for common ground types and common type constructors.

    [Compare] provides a module signature for the standard comparison functions
    and operators as well as modules of that signature for the common OCaml
    ground types ([int], [bool], etc.) and type constructors ([list], [option],
    etc.).

    [Compare] also provides some additional helpers for comparison-related
    tasks. *)

(** {2 Signatures and a functor} *)

(** [COMPARABLE] is a signature for basic comparison. It is used only for
    instantiating full comparison modules of signature {!module-type-S} via the
    functor {!Make}. *)
module type COMPARABLE = sig
  type t

  val compare : t -> t -> int
end

(** [S] is a signature for a fully-fledge comparison module. It includes all the
    functions and operators derived from a [compare] function. *)
module type S = sig
  type t

  (** [x = y] iff [compare x y = 0] *)
  val ( = ) : t -> t -> bool

  (** [x <> y] iff [compare x y <> 0] *)
  val ( <> ) : t -> t -> bool

  (** [x < y] iff [compare x y < 0] *)
  val ( < ) : t -> t -> bool

  (** [x <= y] iff [compare x y <= 0] *)
  val ( <= ) : t -> t -> bool

  (** [x >= y] iff [compare x y >= 0] *)
  val ( >= ) : t -> t -> bool

  (** [x > y] iff [compare x y > 0] *)
  val ( > ) : t -> t -> bool

  (** [compare] an alias for the functor parameter's [compare] function *)
  val compare : t -> t -> int

  (** [equal x y] iff [compare x y = 0] *)
  val equal : t -> t -> bool

  (** [max x y] is [x] if [x >= y] otherwise it is [y] *)
  val max : t -> t -> t

  val min : t -> t -> t
end

module Make (P : COMPARABLE) : S with type t := P.t

(** {2 Base types}

    The specialised comparison and all the specialised functions and operators
    on the base types are compatible with the polymorphic comparison and all the
    polymorphic functions and operators from the {!Stdlib}. *)

module Char : S with type t = char

module Bool : S with type t = bool

(** [Int] is a comparison module. Out of performance concerns, the signature
    actually contains compiler builtins ([external]) rather than [val]. *)

  external ( <> ) : int -> int -> bool = "%notequal"

  external ( < ) : int -> int -> bool = "%lessthan"

(** [Q] is a comparison module for Zarith rationals. *)

(** {2 Type constructors}

    Provided the functor argument(s) are compatible with the polymorphic
    comparison of the {!Stdlib}, then the specialised comparison and all the
    specialised functions and operators on the derived types are compatible with
    the polymorphic comparison and all the polymorphic functions and operators
    from the {!Stdlib}. *)

(** {2 List lengths}

    Helpers for more readable {!Stdlib.List.compare_lengths} and
    {!Stdlib.List.compare_length_with}.

    These modules are intended to be used as [Module.(expression)], most often
    within an [if] condition. E.g.,

   raise Maximum_size_exceeded
