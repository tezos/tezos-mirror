(** A skip list represents a sequence of values. There are three main
    differences between these [skip list]s and OCaml standard [list]s:

    1. A skip list cannot be empty.

    2. A skip list grows at its end.

    3. Each cell of the skip list provides several back pointers
       allowing to *skip* chunk of ancestors of the sequence to directly
       jump to a given position. More precisely, given a [basis]
       parameter, the i-th back pointers of element number [n] in the
       sequence points to [n - n mod basis^i - 1].  The element number [n]
       in the sequence contains [log_basis n] back pointers.

    The skip list is defined by a pair of dereferencing function
    of type ['ptr -> ('content, 'ptr) cell] and the last cell
    of the sequence. The maintainance of this pair is left to the client.
    In particular, the client is responsible to correctly bind a cell
    to each back pointers reachable from the last cell.

    (** [search ~deref ~compare ~cell] allows to find a cell of the skip
     list according to its content. This function assumes that the
     content of the cells is in increasing order according to the
     ordering defined by the function [compare]. In other words, this
     function assumes that [compare] is a function that returns a
     negative integer for cells before the target and a positive
     integer for cells after the target. The value returned by this
     function is [{rev_path; last_cell}] such that.

     - [rev_path = []] if and only if [compare (content cell) > 0]

     - For all the cases below, if there is a path from cell [A] to
     cell [B], [rev_path] contains the list of cells to go from [B] to
     [A]. Consequently, the first element of [rev_path] is [B].
     Except for [Nearest_lower], this path is a minimal path.

     - [last_pointer = Deref_returned_none] if [deref] fails to
     associate a cell to a pointer during the search. In that case,
     [rev_path] is a path from [cell] to [candidate] where [candidate]
     is the last cell for which candidate did not fail and such that
     [compare (content (candidate)) > 0].

     - [last_pointer = No_exact_or_lower_ptr] if for all cell of the
     skip list, [compare (content cell) > 0]. In that case, [rev_path]
     is a path from [cell] to the genesis cell.

     - [last_pointer = Found target] if there is a cell [target] such
     that [compare (content target) = 0] and a path from [cell] to
     [target]. In that case, [rev_path] is the minimal path from
     [cell] to [target].

     - [last_pointer = Nearest_lower {lower;upper}] if there is no
     cell in the skip list such that [compare (content cell) = 0]. In
     that case [lower] is the unique cell such that [compare (content
     lower) < 0] and for all other cells [candidate] such that
     [compare (content candidate) < 0] then there is a path from
     [lower] to [candidate]. [upper], if it exists is the successor
     cell to [lower], i.e. [deref ((back_pointer upper) 0) = Some
     lower].  In that case, [rev_path] is a path from [cell] to
     [lower]. This path is *NOT* minimal but almost. The path is
     minimal from [cell] to [upper=Some up]. By minimality, the path
     is logarithmic. Consequently, since there is a direct pointer
     from [up] to [lower], the passe to [lower] is also
     logarithmic. *)
