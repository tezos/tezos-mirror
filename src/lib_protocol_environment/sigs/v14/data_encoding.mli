    To keep the protocol concise and manageable, we choose to use ad-hoc
    schemas rather than exporting the entire data-encoding library's schema
    types and constructors. This approach enables us to address specific
    cases effectively without burdening the codebase with a complex and
    unnecessary schema definition.

    In most situations, the default schemas should suffice. However, when
    dealing with exceptional cases, targeted fixes can be implemented.

      A note on 31-bit integers. The internal representation of integers in
      OCaml reserves one bit for GC tagging. The remaining bits encode a signed
      integer. For compatibility with 32-bit machine, we restrict these native

(** Big number
      In JSON, data is encoded as a decimal string.
      In binary, data is encoded as a variable length sequence of
      bytes, with a running unary size bit: the most significant bit of
      each byte tells is this is the last byte in the sequence (0) or if
      there is more to read (1). The second most significant bit of the
      first byte is reserved for the sign (positive if zero). Binary_size and

    supports the inclusive range [0] to [(1 lsl 30) - 1].

    The encoding is partial: attempting to de/serialise values which are
    outside of the supported range will fail. In addition, in binary, a
    maximum size for the serialised representation is computed based on the
    maximum value in the range, and the de/serialisation process fails before

      The optional parameters [?min_value] and [?max_value] can be used to

(** Create a single encoding from a series of cases.

    In JSON, all cases are tried one after the other using the [case list]. The
    caller is responsible for avoiding collisions. If there are collisions
    (i.e., if multiple cases produce the same JSON output) then the encoding
    and decoding processes might not be inverse of each other. In other words,
    [destruct e (construct e v)] may not be equal to [v].

    In binary, a prefix tag is added to discriminate quickly between
    cases. The default is [`Uint8] and you must use a [`Uint16] if
    you are going to have more than 256 cases.

    The matching function is used during binary encoding of a value
    [v] to efficiently determine which of the cases corresponds to
    [v]. The case list is used during decoding to reconstruct a value based on
    the encoded tag. (Decoding is optimised internally: tag look-up has a
    constant cost.)

    The caller is responsible for ensuring that the [matching_function] and the
    [case list] describe the same encoding. If they describe different
    encodings, then the decoding and encoding processes will not be inverses of
    each others. In other words, [of_bytes e (to_bytes e v)] will not be equal
    to [v].

    If you do not wish to be responsible for this, you can use the unoptimised
    {!union} that uses a [case list] only (see below). Beware that in {!union}
    the complexity of the encoding is linear in the number of cases.

    same tags, payload conversions, and payload encoding as the [case list].

      cause other failures further down the line when the AST traversal

      The difference of the errors being used when encoding and decoding is
      because when encoding we have access to the list and we can check the

      very restrictive. Still, it can to:

module Compact : sig
  (** This module provides specialized encoding combinators that are
      implemented to reduce the size of the serialization result.

      The main trick this module relies on is the notion of “shared tags”.
      In [Data_encoding], the [union] combinator uses (at least) one byte
      every time it is used, to “tag” the output and distinguish between
      various disjunction cases. As a consequence, if [n] [union] are
      composed together to define one encoding, (at least) [n] bytes are
      being allocated. However, in practice, only few bits are used in
      each tags, which means the rest is “wasted.”

      As an example, consider this type:

      {[
      type t =
        | T1 of { f1 : int option; f2 : (int, bool) Either.t }
        | T2 of { f3: int }
      ]}

      A value of [t] using the constructor [T1] will be serialized into
      a binary array of this form:

      {v
      ┌────────┬─────────┬─────────────┬─────────┬─────────────┐
      │ tag(t) │ tag(f1) │ payload(f1) │ tag(f2) │ payload(f2) │
      └────────┴─────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴─────────────┘
        1 byte   1 byte    N bytes       1 byte    M bytes
      v}

      Where [tag(f)] is a value used by [Data_encoding] to distinguish
      between several encoding alternatives for [f], and [payload(f)] is
      the resulting binary array.

      For both [option] and [Either.t], the tag of the encoding only uses
      one bit in practice. Which means that for [T1], encoding the pair
      [(f1, f2)] needs two bits, but the default approach of
      [Data_encoding] uses two {i bytes} instead.  Similarly, to
      distinguish between [T1] and [T2] needs one bit, but the default
      approach is to use an additional tag (one additional {i byte}).

      This module provides an approach to tackle this issue, by
      allocating only one tag ({i i.e.}, one byte) that is used to store
      the useful bits to distinguish between the disjunction cases. We
      call this tag the “shared tag” of the encoding. The bits of the
      shared tag describes precisely the layout of the encoded data.

      For instance, considering a compact encoding for [t], the third
      bit of the tag can be used to distinguish between [T1] and [T2].
      In case the third bit is 0, the first bit of the tag determines
      the case of [option], and the second the case of [Either.t].

      As a consequence the resulting binary array for the constructor
      [T1] is, using
      - [_] to represent meaningless bits,
      - [0] and [1] to represent actual bit values,
      - [e] to represent the bit used to distinguish the [Either] case of [f2], and
      - [o] to represent the bit used to distinguish the [Option] case of [f1]:

      {v
      ┌──────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
      │ _____0eo │ payload(f1) │ payload(f2) │
      └──────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
        1 byte     N bytes       M bytes
      v}

      while the resulting binary array for the constructor [T2] is

      {v
      ┌──────────┬─────────────┐
      │ _____100 │ payload(f3) │
      └──────────┴─────────────┘
        1 byte     N bytes
      v} *)

      encodings (say, when you have two bits of tag to spare anyway) or given
      a very skewed distribution of values (say, when the vast majority of

  (** [list ~bits:n encoding] uses [n] bits in the shared tag to encode the

      {ul {li [00]: the payload is empty, because it is the empty list}

  (** [union cases] creates a new compact encoding to encompass a
      disjunction of cases.

      The value uses some tag bits to distinguish the different cases of the
      union (see discussion of parameter [union_tag_bits]) and some tag bits
      (potentially 0) to distinguish the values within a case (see discussion
      of parameter [cases_tag_bits]).

      E.g., Given [type t = A of bool | B of int option] and the encoding
      {v
      let c =
        union [
          case "A" (function A b -> Some b | _ -> None) (fun b -> A b) bool;
          case "B" (function B i -> Some i | _ -> None) (fun i -> B b) (option (payload int));
      in
      make ~tag_size:`Uint8 c
      v}
      then a value can have either of the following 4 tags:
      - 0b00000000: case [A], [false]
      - 0b00000001: case [A], [true]
      - 0b00000010: case [B], [Some] (a payload of 4 bytes follows)
      - 0b00000011: case [B], [None]

      In other words, the second bit of this tag is used to discriminate the
      cases of the union, whilst the first bit is used to discriminate within
      each case.

      Note that the compact union can be combined with more compact encoding
      before being passed to [make] in which case the two bits of tags will be
      combined with the tags of the other compact encodings. E.g.,
      [make ~tag_size:`Uint8 (tup2 c c)].

      @param union_tag_bits is the number of bits used to distinguish the
      different cases of the union. For example, if the union has 4 cases
      (i.e., if [List.length cases = 4]) then you can use [~union_tag_bits:2].

      If not provided explicitly, [union_tag_bits] is inferred: it is set to
      the smallest value which can accommodate the provided [cases].

      It is recommended to set [union_tag_bits] explicitly.

      You can over-provision the [union_tag_bits] if you expect the
      [cases] to grow in the future.

      @raise Invalid_argument if the value passed for [union_tag_bits] is not
      sufficient to distinguish between the [cases].

      @param cases_tag_bits is the number of bits that each of the [cases] can
      use. This is only useful if the cases use more than 0 bits of tag.

      It is recommended to set [cases_tag_bits] explicitly if you need the
      layout to be stable even if the [cases] or one of its element changes.

      You can over-provision the [cases_tag_bits] if you expect one of the
      cases to change to use more bits of tag or if you expect that a new case
      using more tag bits will be added in the future.

      E.g., passing [~cases_tag_bits:7] to the [union] in the example above
      will cause the values to be represented as follows:
      - 0b00000000: case [A], [false]
      - 0b00000001: case [A], [true]
      - 0b10000000: case [B], [Some] (a payload of 4 bytes follows)
      - 0b10000001: case [B], [None]

      @raise Invalid_argument if one of the elements of [cases] needs more
      than [cases_tag_bits] bits of tag.

      E.g., [union ~cases_tag_bits:0 [case "Bool" Option.some Fun.id bool]]
      raises [Invalid_argument] because {!bool} uses one bit of tag which is
      more than [0].

      @raise Invalid_argument if [cases] is empty. *)
  val union : ?union_tag_bits:int -> ?cases_tag_bits:int -> 'a case list -> 'a t

  (** [void_case ~title] is an impossible case. It is provided so you can add
      unused tags within a union. E.g.,
      [union [case _; void_case ~title:"reserved-for-v04-compatibility"; case _; case _]]
      uses two bits of tag for the discrimination of the union,
      but the tag [01] is unused (reserved for some version compatibility). *)
