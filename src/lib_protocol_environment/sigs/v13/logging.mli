(** Logging levels.  See [docs/developer/guidelines.rst] for their meaning *)
type level = Debug | Info | Notice | Warning | Error | Fatal

(** Logs a message. It is the shell's responsibility to manage the actual
    logging.

    Even though logging may involve system calls, formatting, or other work, the
    shell guarantees that calling this function doesn't transfer control over
    another promise. Consequently, the performance of this function can be
    considered predictable from the point of view of gas-consumption.

    Note that the function call has predictable performance, but that it is the
    caller's responsibility to ensure that argument evaluation has predictable
    performance too. E.g., [log Notice "%s" (Format.asprint â€¦)] may spend time
    formatting the argument string. *)
val log : level -> ('a, Format.formatter, unit, unit) format4 -> 'a

(** Same as [log] but more efficient with a simpler interface. *)
val log_string : level -> string -> unit
