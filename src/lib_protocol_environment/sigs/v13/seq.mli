    Note that [first] forces the first element of the sequence, which can have
    side-effects or be computationally expensive. Consider, e.g., the case
    where [s = filter (fun â€¦) s']: [first s] can force multiple of the values
    from [s']. *)

(** Similar to {!fold_left} but wraps the traversing in [result Lwt.t].

    either:
    - is rejected if at least one of the promises is, otherwise
    - is fulfilled with [Error _] if at least one of the promises is,
      otherwise
    - is fulfilled with [Ok ()] if all the promises are. *)

(** Similar to {!iter} but wraps the iteration in {!Lwt}. All the
    steps of the iteration are started concurrently. The promise [iter_p f s]
    is resolved only once all the promises of the iteration are. At this point
    it is either fulfilled if all promises are, or rejected if at least one of
    them is. *)
