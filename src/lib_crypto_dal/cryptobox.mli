(** {1 Cryptography for the Data Availability Layer}

    The Data Availability Layer (DAL) reduces the storage strain on the
    blockchain by only storing on-chain constant-size cryptographic
    {!type:commitment}s to arbitrary data blobs called {!type:slot}s.
    The slots themselves are stored off-chain and are made available by the DAL.

    A slot is encoded with some redundancy using a so-called MDS (Maximum
    Distance Separable) code. The resulting encoded slot is partitioned into
    {!type:shard}s, allowing retrieval of the slot with any subset of
    [{!field:parameters.number_of_shards}/{!field:parameters.redundancy_factor}]
    out of [{!field:parameters.number_of_shards}] shards. By doing so,
    we can guarantee high data availability provided a certain fraction of
    the DAL nodes is storing and supplying the data. This fraction can be
    made as small as desired at the expense of a higher data redundancy
    {!field:parameters.redundancy_factor}. MDS codes have no unnecessary
    redundancy.

    One can verify in constant time that the correct shard was retrieved
    using a constant-sized
    {{: https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2010/6477178/6477178.pdf}KZG proof}
    {!type:shard_proof} (see function [verifyEval] in section 3.3) and the
    slot commitment.

    A {!type:slot} is partioned into
    [{!field:parameters.slot_size}/{!field:parameters.page_size}] segments
    called {!type:Verifier.page}s of size {!field:parameters.page_size}.
    One can also verify in constant time that the correct page
    was retrieved using a KZG proof {!type:page_proof} and the slot commitment.

    A challenge is to keep the proving time for the {!type:shard_proof}s
    almost proportional to the length [n] of the slot encoded with the MDS
    code: we've chosen and implemented a technique to produce the proofs in
    time [O(n log n)]
    (see {{: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/033.pdf}Fast amortized KZG proofs}).
    
    More diverse details about the formalization are provided here :

type t

(** Because of the shell/protocol separation, cryptographic primitives
   need to be splitted. An interface, called the {!module:Verifier}
   aims to be provided for the economic protocol. The other interface,
   called the [Builder] is for the shell.

    A [Verifier], as hinted by the name, mainly needs to check
   proofs:

    1. A proof that a commitment is valid

    2. A proof that a page is valid

   A technicality is that the economic protocol is able to configure
   those cryptographic primitives via several constants.  Also, an SRS
   (aka trusted setup) is required.

   It is the responsibility of the shell and the protocol to ensure
   that both the [Verifier] and the [Builder] are instantiated with the
   same parameters and use the same trusted setup. *)
