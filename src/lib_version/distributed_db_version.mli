(** This version adds the following messages:

    - [Get_checkpoint/Checkpoint] for fetching the checkpoint of a
   peer.

    - [Get_protocol_branch/Protocol_branch] for fetching the branch of
   a peer given a protocol level.

    - [Get_predecessor_header/Predecessor_header] for fetching a block
   header given an offset from a block hash.

    Those messages can help to implement a faster bootstrap. *)
val one : t

(** This version adds no messages. However, the semantics of the
   message [Current_head] is changed. In particular, a peer can send a
   message [Current_head] which was only [validated] but the block
   was not applied yet. This means that a [peer] which sends a
   [Current_head] message with a block for which the [validate]
   function will return [true] but is invalid should not be kicked
   anymore. *)
