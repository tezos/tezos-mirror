(** Version information.

    This module provides the current version number. *)

(** Additional version information.

    [Dev] means "Development Version".
    All non-release branches should use this.

    [Beta] refers to a version that is not believed to be stable
    but contains features for the next release.
    For each release, the first beta version has number 1.

    [Beta_dev] refers to a beta version "in development".

    [RC] means "Release Candidate".
    For each release, the first release candidate has number 1.

    [RC_dev] means "Release Candidate in development".
    This is a release branch where the release candidate tag is
    not associated to the HEAD of the branch.

    [Release] means "no additional information".
    This is an actual released version.
    No additional info is printed.

    Documentation on the semantics of version numbers is available
    at [docs/releases/releases.rst]. *)
type additional_info = Tezos_version_parser.additional_info =
  | Dev
  | Beta of int
  | Beta_dev of int
  | RC of int
  | RC_dev of int
  | Release

(** Convert additional version information to a string.

    The result is a string of the form ["+dev"], ["~rcX"], ["~rcX+dev"] or [""]. *)
val string_of_additional_info : additional_info -> string

(** Product information. *)
type product = Tezos_version_parser.product = Octez | Octez_evm_node

(** Convert the product information to a string. *)
val string_of_product : product -> string

(** Version information of the [product].

    Major versions include significant new features and are usually
    released in new branches which start from master.

    Minor versions include mostly bug fixes and are usually released in
    branches which start from the previous release.
    When the major version is incremented, the minor version is reset to 0. *)
type t = Tezos_version_parser.t = {
  product : product;
  major : int;
  minor : int;
  additional_info : additional_info;
}

(** Convert a version to a string.

    Examples:
    - [to_string { major = 7; minor = 0; additional_info = Release } = "7.0"]
    - [to_string { major = 7; minor = 0; additional_info = Dev } = "7.0+dev"]
    - [to_string { major = 7; minor = 0; additional_info = RC 1 } = "7.0~rc1"]
    - [to_string { major = 7; minor = 0; additional_info = RC_dev 1 } = "7.0~rc1+dev"] *)
val to_string : t -> string

(** [to_json version commit_hash] json representation of a [version] and [commit_hash] as string.

    Returns, as a string, a json object with the fields:
    - [product], [major], [minor], [info] corresponding to the given fields of [version.]
    - [hash], containing [commit_hash]. *)
val to_json : t -> string -> string

(** Version printer.

    [pp f x] prints [to_string x] in [f] *)
val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** A simpler version printer.

    Same as [pp] but does not print the product name. *)
val pp_simple : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** A Version printer compatible with command line argments.

    Same as [pp] but print the product name in lowercase and followed by a dash
    instead of a space. *)
val pp_arg : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** Parse an Octez version.

   Returns None if the version cannot be parsed. *)
val parse_version : string -> t option
