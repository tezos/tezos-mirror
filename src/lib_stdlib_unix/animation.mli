(** [make_with_animation] is meant to be used to execute time consuming
    functions that can be interrupted. Typically proof-of-work tasks. Whilst
    doing so, it displays a progress animation on the provided formatter
    (assumes support for '\b`). The animations leave the terminal clean.

    [make_with_animation ppf ~make ~on_retry seed] behaves as follows:
    (a) if [make seed] is [Ok v] (completion of the task), then it returns [v]
    (b) if [make seed] is [Error r] (task is incomplete), then
    (b.1) [on_retry t r] is evaluated where [t] is the time elapsed during the
    call to [make], and then
    (b.2) the result is used to attempt the task again. *)

(** This list associates each [progress_display_mode] constructor with its
    textual representation. The main use case of this list is [enum] combinator,
    e.g. from [cmdliner] or [data_encoding] libraries.*)

val number_of_frames : int

(** [display_progress ?every ?out ~progress_display_mode ~pp_print_step f]
    [pp_print_step] is called once with [0] before the first trace of
    [f] and then each time the argument passed to [f] is called to notify that
    a step has finished, incrementing the number which will be given to
    [pp_print_step] between each call.

    If [every] is passed, it is instead displayed whenever [nb_step
    mod every = 0] (defaults to 1). Each time [pp_print_step] is
    called, the previous output will be erased and replaced by the new
    output.

    [progress_display_mode] determines whether progress animation should be
    displayed to the given [out]. When [Auto], animation is displayed
    based on [isatty] result. When [Always], animation is always displayed
    in the [out]. When [Never], animation isn't displayed in the [out].

    [pp_print_step] must only write on a single-line with no carriage
    return.

    @raise Invalid_argument if the given [every] is less than 1.*)
