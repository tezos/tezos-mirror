(** The module [Files] handles writing and reading into memory-mapped files. A

    to [max_number_of_keys_per_file - 1]). As values within a file have a fixed size, the
    index encodes the position of the associated value within the physical file.

    This module basically implements the key-value store, by grouping sets of
    key-value pairs in files. Each file comes with its own layout, specifying in
    particular the value size.

    This module must properly handle resource utilization, especially file
    descriptors.

    The structure {!Files.t} guarantees that no more than the specified
    [lru_size] file descriptors can be open at the same time.

     As a consequence, a read or write in the store can remove another
     file from the LRU. If an action was already performing on such a
     file, the store waits for this action to be terminated and close
     the file before opening a new one.

     (C) filename \in files -> filename \in lru

     does not hold.

     after the store has been closed will fail. The promise returned
