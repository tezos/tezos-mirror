(** This module handles set of rules for log sections specific configurations.
    For instance, if one want enable section "node.context" at level debug, it
    would be written "node.context -> debug". The complete syntax is the
    following

      <rules> := <rule> ; <rules>
      <rule> := (<pattern> ->)? <level>
      <pattern> := <string> | * | <pattern>.<pattern>

    A value of this form can be found in environment variables TEZOS_LOG and
    LWT_LOG.
