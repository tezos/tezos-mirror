type error += Failed_to_parse_address of (string * string)

(** [resolve_addr_with_peer_id ~default_addr ~default_port ?passive ?warn
    addr] parses [addr] to return the corresponding points.

    The format of [addr] can be either an IP address (v4 or v6) or a
    domain name. If a domain name is provided, a DNS lookup is made
    (see {!val:Unix.getaddrinfo}).

    Moreover, a peer id can be provided by postfixing the addr with
    [#<peer_id>]. The peer id should be provided using the b58 format.

    An event is emitted if the DNS lookup returned 0 points and [warn] is true.
    If [warn] is false, no event is emitted. The default is true.

    The error [Failed_to_parse_address] is returned if the parsing failed.  *)
