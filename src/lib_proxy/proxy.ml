type 'a update = Mutation | Value of 'a

(** An ad-hoc module type used by implementations of the proxy mode
    when it uses the [../raw/bytes] RPC to query its distant endpoint.
    It is ad-hoc because its [get] function has the concrete {!Proxy_context.M.tree}
    as a return type and because [add_leaf] has the concrete
    {!Tezos_context_sigs.Context.Proof_types.raw_context} as a parameter
    (this type is inherited from the return type of the [../raw/bytes] RPC). *)

  (** [add_leaf t key raw_ctxt] returns a variant of [t] where [key] is
      mapped to [raw_ctxt]. When this function is called, it transforms
      [raw_ctxt], under the hood, into an instance of {!Proxy_context.M.tree},
      as the latter is the type internally stored in {!t} (it needs to be,
      as it's the return type of {!get}).

      This function is called [add_leaf], because the proxy mode iteratively
      builds its local copy of the endpoint's data. This function is only called
      when adding a new leaf in the tree of data, never to replace existing
      data. In other words, it's not a general purpose setter. *)
