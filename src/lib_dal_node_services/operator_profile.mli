(* This module handle operator profiles for the DAL node *)

(** An operator DAL node can play three different roles:
    - attester for some pkh: checks that the shards assigned to this pkh are published
    - slot producer for some slot index: splits slots into shards and publishes the shards
    - slot observer for some slot index: collects the shards
    corresponding to some slot index, reconstructs slots when enough
    shards are seen, and republishes missing shards.

    A single DAL node can play several of these roles at once. We call a profile the
    set of roles played by a DAL node and represent it as a triple of sets. *)
