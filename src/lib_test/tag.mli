(** Test tags with specific semantics. *)

(** The following values are string constants that can be added to [~tags]
    in [Test.register]. They have specific semantics that is documented here.
    By using [Tag.x] instead of ["x"] in [~tags], you allow developers
    to jump to the definition of [Tag.x] and thus see the documentation of the tag.
    You also avoid mistakes like using ["ci_disable"] instead of ["ci_disabled"]. *)

(** ["flaky"]: the test is flaky.

    The semantics depends on other tags:
    - if the test also has tag {!memory_3k}, {!memory_4k} or {!time_sensitive},
      the test still runs in job [tezt-memory-3k], [tezt-memory-4k]
      or [tezt-time-sensitive] respectively;
    - if the test also has tag {!slow}, the test still runs in job [tezt-slow]
      but this job is manual, so it does not run by default, except in
      scheduled pipelines;
    - if the test has none of these other tags, the test still runs in job [tezt-flaky],
      but this job is manual, so it does not run by default, except in
      scheduled pipelines; additionally, this job is allowed to fail.

    In the general case, this tag thus disables the test in [before_merging]
    pipelines of the CI just like {!ci_disabled}.
    Contrary to {!ci_disabled} however, this also gives the reason
    why the test is disabled: the test is flaky.

    Tip: you can list tests that are declared as flaky with [tezt --list flaky].
    You can check if they are still flaky with something like
    [tezt flaky --loop-count 100].

    Since this tag already conveys information about why the test is disabled,
    and since it is easy to get the list of tests with this tag,
    it is not necessarily needed to create an issue for each flaky test. *)
val flaky : string

(** ["ci_disabled"]: disable test in the CI.

    The test is not to be run in the CI.
    You must provide a comment to explain why the test is disabled.
    For flaky tests, {!flaky} should be preferred to [ci_disabled]. *)
val ci_disabled : string

(** ["memory_3k"]: tag memory hungry tests ( >3 GB of memory ). *)
val memory_3k : string

(** ["memory_4k"]: tag memory hungry tests ( >4 GB of memory ). *)
val memory_4k : string

(** ["time_sensitive"]: tag for time-sensitive tests.

    They are executed with -j 1 to ensure that other tests do not
    affect their executions. However, they are not particularly
    cpu/memory-intensive hence they do not need to run on a particular
    machine contrary to performance regression tests. *)
val time_sensitive : string

(** ["infrastructure"]: tag for tests owned by the Infrastructure product unit. *)
val infrastructure : string

(** ["layer1"]: tag for tests owned by the Layer 1 product unit. *)
val layer1 : string

(** ["tezos2"]: tag for tests owned by the Tezos 2 product unit. *)
val tezos2 : string

(** ["etherlink"]: tag for tests owned by the Etherlink product unit. *)
val etherlink : string

(** ["base"]: tag for tests related to lib_base. *)
val base : string

(** ["shell"]: tag for tests related to lib_shell and lib_shell_services. *)
val shell : string

(** ["encodings"]: tag for tests related to encodings. *)
val encodings : string

(** ["services"]: tag for tests related to services. *)
val services : string

(** ["unix"]: tag for tests related to unix. *)
val unix : string

(** ["slow"]: tag for tests that are too slow for the CI's [before_merging]
    pipelines and that will only be run on the scheduled pipeline.

    This tag should be used for tests that take more than 2 minutes in the CI. *)
val slow : string

(** [cloud]: tag for tests that depends on the [tezt-cloud] library. Such a test
  uses VMs deployed onto the cloud. *)
val cloud : string
