SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO 

HAMLET

    So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
    You do remember all the circumstance?

HORATIO

    Remember it, my lord?

HAMLET

    Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
    That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
    And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
    When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will,--

HORATIO

    That is most certain.

HAMLET

    Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold,
    My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
    O royal knavery!--an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons
    Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
    With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.

HORATIO

    Is't possible?

HAMLET

    Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

HORATIO

    I beseech you.

HAMLET

    Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
    Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play--I sat me down,
    Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
    The effect of what I wrote?

HORATIO

    Ay, good my lord.

HAMLET

    An earnest conjuration from the king,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving-time allow'd.

HORATIO

    How was this seal'd?

HAMLET

    Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in form of the other,
    Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.

HORATIO

    So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

HAMLET

    Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow:
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.

HORATIO

    Why, what a king is this!

HAMLET

    Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
    He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
    Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
    To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?

HORATIO

    It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.

HAMLET

    It will be short: the interim is mine;
    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself;
    For, by the image of my cause, I see
    The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
    But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a towering passion.

HORATIO

    Peace! who comes here?

    Enter OSRIC

OSRIC

    Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

HAMLET

    I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?

HORATIO

    No, my good lord.

HAMLET

    Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
    know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
    beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
    the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
    spacious in the possession of dirt.

OSRIC

    Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
    should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

HAMLET

    I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
    spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.

OSRIC

    I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

HAMLET

    No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
    northerly.

OSRIC

    It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

HAMLET

    But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
    complexion.

OSRIC

    Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
    'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
    majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
    great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--

HAMLET

    I beseech you, remember--

    HAMLET moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC

    Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
    Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
    me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
    differences, of very soft society and great showing:
    indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
    calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
    continent of what part a gentleman would see.

HAMLET

    Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
    though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
    dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
    neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
    verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
    great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
    rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
    semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
    him, his umbrage, nothing more.

OSRIC

    Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

HAMLET

    The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
    in our more rawer breath?

OSRIC

    Sir?

HORATIO

    Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
    You will do't, sir, really.

HAMLET

    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

OSRIC

    Of Laertes?

HORATIO

    His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.

HAMLET

    Of him, sir.

OSRIC

    I know you are not ignorant--

HAMLET

    I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
    it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

OSRIC

    You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

HAMLET

    I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
    him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
    know himself.

OSRIC

    I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
    laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

HAMLET

    What's his weapon?

OSRIC

    Rapier and dagger.

HAMLET

    That's two of his weapons: but, well.

OSRIC

    The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
    horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
    it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
    assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
    carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
    responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
    and of very liberal conceit.

HAMLET

    What call you the carriages?

HORATIO

    I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.

OSRIC

    The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

HAMLET

    The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
    could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
    be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
    against six French swords, their assigns, and three
    liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
    against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?

OSRIC

    The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
    between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
    three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
    would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
    would vouchsafe the answer.

HAMLET

    How if I answer 'no'?

OSRIC

    I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

HAMLET

    Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
    majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
    the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
    king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
    if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

OSRIC

    Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

HAMLET

    To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

OSRIC

    I commend my duty to your lordship.

HAMLET

    Yours, yours.

    Exit OSRIC
    He does well to commend it himself; there are no
    tongues else for's turn.

HORATIO

    This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

HAMLET

    He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
    Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
    know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
    the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
    yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
    but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

    Enter a Lord

Lord

    My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
    Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
    the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
    play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.

HAMLET

    I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
    pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
    or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.

Lord

    The king and queen and all are coming down.

HAMLET

    In happy time.

Lord

    The queen desires you to use some gentle
    entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

HAMLET

    She well instructs me.

    Exit Lord

HORATIO

    You will lose this wager, my lord.

HAMLET

    I do not think so: since he went into France, I
    have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
    odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
    about my heart: but it is no matter.

HORATIO

    Nay, good my lord,--

HAMLET

    It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
    gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

HORATIO

    If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
    forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
    fit.

HAMLET

    Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
    'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
    now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
    readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
    leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c

KING CLAUDIUS

    Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

    KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's

HAMLET

    Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done,
    That might your nature, honour and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
    If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
    That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    And hurt my brother.

LAERTES

    I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
    To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
    Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
    I have a voice and precedent of peace,
    To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.

HAMLET

    I embrace it freely;
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.

LAERTES

    Come, one for me.

HAMLET

    I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.

LAERTES

    You mock me, sir.

HAMLET

    No, by this hand.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?

HAMLET

    Very well, my lord
    Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

LAERTES

    This is too heavy, let me see another.

HAMLET

    This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

    They prepare to play

OSRIC

    Ay, my good lord.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
    The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
    And in the cup an union shall he throw,
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
    'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
    And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

HAMLET

    Come on, sir.

LAERTES

    Come, my lord.

    They play

HAMLET

    One.

LAERTES

    No.

HAMLET

    Judgment.

OSRIC

    A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES

    Well; again.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.

    Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
    Give him the cup.

HAMLET

    I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.

    They play
    Another hit; what say you?

LAERTES

    A touch, a touch, I do confess.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Our son shall win.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
    The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    Good madam!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Gertrude, do not drink.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

HAMLET

    I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES

    My lord, I'll hit him now.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I do not think't.

LAERTES

    [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

HAMLET

    Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
    I pray you, pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

LAERTES

    Say you so? come on.

    They play

OSRIC

    Nothing, neither way.

LAERTES

    Have at you now!

    LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS

    Part them; they are incensed.

HAMLET

    Nay, come, again.

    QUEEN GERTRUDE falls

OSRIC

    Look to the queen there, ho!

HORATIO

    They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

OSRIC

    How is't, Laertes?

LAERTES

    Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

HAMLET

    How does the queen?

KING CLAUDIUS

    She swounds to see them bleed.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.

    Dies

HAMLET

    O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
    Treachery! Seek it out.

LAERTES

    It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good;
    In thee there is not half an hour of life;
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
    Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
    I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

HAMLET

    The point!--envenom'd too!
    Then, venom, to thy work.

    Stabs KING CLAUDIUS

All

    Treason! treason!

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

HAMLET

    Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.

    KING CLAUDIUS dies

LAERTES

    He is justly served;
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me.

    Dies

HAMLET

    Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
    Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.

HORATIO

    Never believe it:
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
    Here's yet some liquor left.

HAMLET

    As thou'rt a man,
    Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.

    March afar off, and shot within
    What warlike noise is this?

OSRIC

    Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.

HAMLET

    O, I die, Horatio;
    The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
    I cannot live to hear the news from England;
    But I do prophesy the election lights
    On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
    So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

    Dies

HORATIO

    Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
    Why does the drum come hither?

    March within

    Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Where is this sight?

HORATIO

    What is it ye would see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck?

First Ambassador

    The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late:
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
    Where should we have our thanks?

HORATIO

    Not from his mouth,
    Had it the ability of life to thank you:
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arrived give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about: so shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
    Truly deliver.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
    Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

HORATIO

    Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
    On plots and errors, happen.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
    Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

    A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
