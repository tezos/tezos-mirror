    - {!Storage.Delegates}

    self-delegated, that is a delegate's implicit account delegates to itself
    (i.e. {!Contract_delegate_storage.find} [delegate] returns [delegate]),
    - registered delegates have their public keys revealed,
    - registered delegates cannot change their delegation,
    - stake is properly moved when changing delegation.
