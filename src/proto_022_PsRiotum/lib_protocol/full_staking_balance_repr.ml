(** This module is responsible for the construction, observation and encoding of
    full staking balances that are maintained to be used at cycle end to compute
    staking rights.

    The module supports lazy migrations both from Oxford to Paris and
    from Paris to Q. See comments on [encoding] below.
*)

(** This type gathers the information we need to store so that we can
    provide the [min_delegated_in_cycle] public function (used for
    baking right computation at cycle end) and
    [Internal_for_tests_and_RPCs.min_delegated_and_level] (for
    the [<block>/context/delegates/min_delegated_in_current_cycle]
    RPC).

    [last_modified_level] is always the level of the last modification
    to [t.delegated], regardless of whether it was an increase or
    decrease. (If [t.delegated] has never been modified since its
    creation, then [last_modified_level] is the level at which it has
    been created, that is, when the delegate has set its delegation to
    itself.)

    Special case: when decoding a value that has been encoded during
    an older protocol than Q, [last_modified_level] is set to [0]; see
    [encoding] below for more details.

    [previous_min] contains the value and level of the min of
    [t.delegated] from the start of [last_modified_level.cycle], up
    until BEFORE any modifications that have happened during
    [last_modified_level].

    [previous_min] is [None] in three cases:

    - when [t.delegated] hasn't changed since the level of the
    delegate's creation, that is, the level at which the delegate has
    started self-delegating.

    - when [last_modified_level] is the first level of
    [last_modified_level.cycle]. Indeed, in this case, there are no
    values of [t.delegated] that are both before [last_modified_level]
    and in the same cycle as it.

    - when decoding a value that has been encoded during a protocol
    before Q; see [encoding] below for more details.

    Invariant:
    If [previous_min = Some (previous_min_value, previous_min_level)] then
    - [previous_min_level.cycle = last_modified_level.cycle] and
    - [previous_min_level < last_modified_level]

    This invariant is enforced thanks to the following
    post-conditions, that are satisfied by all functions that create
    or modify a [min_delegated_t], where [current_level] is the level
    during which the creation/modification happens.

    - [last_modified_level = current_level]

    - If [previous_min = Some (previous_min_value, previous_min_level)] then:
      - [previous_min_level.cycle = current_level.cycle] and
      - [previous_min_level < current_level]

    (Note: decoding a value that has been encoded during an old
    protocol does not satisfy [last_modified_level = current_level],
    but it always sets [previous_min] to [None] anyway, so the
    invariant still holds.)

(* This encoding is backward-compatible with both the encodings used
   in Oxford and in Paris, to allow for lazy migrations.

   In Oxford, {!field-min_delegated_in_cycle} didn't exist at all See
   [Full_staking_balance_repr_oxford] in
   [test/unit/test_full_staking_balance_repr.ml]. A decoded value was
   encoded during Oxford (or before) IFF the "min_delegated_in_cycle"
   field is [None].

   In Paris, {!field-min_delegated_in_cycle} was of type [Tez_repr.t],
   and there was another field [level_of_min_delegated : Level_repr.t
   option]. Both were stored inside the "min_delegated_in_cycle" field
   in the Paris encoding, with the following encoding:

   {[
    obj2
      (req "min_delegated_in_cycle" Tez_repr.encoding)
      (req "level_of_min_delegated" (option Level_repr.encoding))
   ]}

   A decoded value was encoded during Paris IFF the
   "min_delegated_in_cycle" field is present, but its
   "last_modified_level" field is [None].

   When reading any value that was encoded during a pre-Q protocol, we
   don't actually care about its min-delegated-related field. So we
   set [previous_min] to [None] and [last_modified_level] to zero, and
   we will treat them as coming from an old cycle.

   If this lazy migration happens in the middle of a cycle (which
   shouldn't be the case because the new min-delegated semantics is a
   new feature, not a bug fix, so it should be activated as a result
   of the voting process), this means the cycle that contained the
   migration, the min will be computed only during the Q portion of
   the cycle, not the whole cycle.

   Note that we can't use [previous_min_level = None] to signal a
   value that was read from an older protocol, because it already
   signifies that [previous_min = None] which has a semantic of its
   own.

    (* This encoding must be backward-compatible with the [added_in_p]
       encoding of [Full_staking_balance_repr_paris.encoding] in
       [test/unit/test_full_staking_balance_repr.ml]. That's why
       "previous_min_level" has to be an option, whereas
       "previous_min_value" cannot be an option.

       - "previous_min_level" contains the level part of
       {!field-previous_min} when it's [Some _], otherwise [None].

       - "previous_min_value" contains the tez part of
       {!field-previous_min} when it's [Some _], otherwise
       [Tez_repr.zero].

       - "last_modified_level" contains
       {!field-last_modified_level}. So this field is always provided
       when using this encoding to serialize a
       {!min_delegated_t}. When decoding, if this field is missing,
       this means that the value comes from the Paris encoding.

       Since only the binary encoding is used in the context and not
       the json one, we use different names for the fields. Thus, this
       encoding is only *binary* backward-compatible with both the
       encodings used in Oxford and in Paris. *)

            This means that [min_delegated_value = delegated], and

         b. [last_modified_level] is the first level of the current
            cycle, and [delegated] has not been modified since, so:
            [min_delegated_and_level = (delegated, last_modified_level)]

         c. The value has been decoded from an older protocol. This
            means that [delegated] has not changed since the activation of
            the current protocol, so:
            [min_delegated_and_level = (delegated, first_level_of_current_cycle)]

         Notice that in case b, we know that
         [last_modified_level.cycle = current_cycle] is true.
         Moreover, in case c, {!encoding} sets [last_modified_level]
         to zero; and it's the only way for [last_modified_level] to
         be zero, since level zero always belongs to the starting
         protocol (Genesis or 000). So all three cases a, b, and c
         boil down to:

         [min_delegated_and_level =
            ( delegated,
              if last_modified_level.cycle = current_cycle
