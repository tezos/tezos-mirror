(*
   A ZKRU Update will set a new ZKRU state if the proof sent in the payload
   is verified. In order to verify this proof, the protocol needs to
   compute the "public inputs" expected by the Plonk circuits that define
   a given ZKRU.
   The proof's public inputs have to be collected by the protocol, as some of
   them will be passed in the operation's payload, but some must be computed
   by the protocol (e.g. the current L2 state).
   These public inputs will be collected as a string map linking
   the circuit identifier to a list of inputs for it (as a circuit might have
   been used several times in a proof).
   As explained in the documentation, circuits in ZKRUs will be grouped into
   three categories: pending (public) operations, private batches and
   fee circuit.
   Each of these expects a different set of public inputs. For this reason,
   the collection of circuit inputs will be collected in three separate steps.
