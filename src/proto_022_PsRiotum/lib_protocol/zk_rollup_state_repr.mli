(** The state of a ZK Rollup is an opaque array of scalars, and represents
    the L1's view of the L2 state.
    Although the length of this array is unbound, this type should describe
    a succinct representation of the entire RU state. Upon origination, the
    length of a ZKRU's state is fixed.
