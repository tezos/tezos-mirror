    whether the DAL attestation [attestation] emitted at given [level] by the
    attester with the given [consensus_key] and given [slot] is valid. If an
    [Error _] is returned, the [op] is not valid. The checks made are:
    * the attestation size does not exceed the maximum;
    * the delegate is in the DAL committee.

    These are checks done for the DAL part alone, checks on other fields of an
    attestation (like level, round) are done by the caller. *)
