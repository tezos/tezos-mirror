(** Merkelizing inbox for smart-contract rollups.

   {1 Overview}

   The inbox of a smart-contract rollup denotes the incoming messages
   of the rollup. This inbox is the source of truth about what
   operations are being published and have an effect on the rollup
   state. As such, the inbox completely determines the state of the
   rollup. Hence, if two claims disagree about the state of the
   rollup, there are only two possibilities: either these two claims
   correspond to two distinct interpretations of the same inbox ; or,
   these two claims differ on their views about the contents of the
   inbox itself. {!Sc_rollup_PVM_sig} is meant to arbitrate the first
   kind of conflicts while {!Sc_rollup_inbox_repr} focuses on the second
   kind of conflicts.

   {1 Inbox messages}

   A message is a chunk of bytes. Messages are indexed using natural
   numbers and the level they are introduced.

   A message is said to be *consumed* when its processing has been
   cemented, that is, when no refutation about its insertion can
   happen anymore because the commitment that describes the effect of
   this message on the state is cemented. A message is said to be
   *available* (for dispute) if it is not consumed.

   A message processed by the rollup can be consumed or available. A
   message unprocessed by the rollup is always available.

   The number of messages in an inbox level is bounded by
   {!Constants_repr.sc_rollup_max_number_of_messages_per_level}
   When a level inbox reaches the maximum number of messages in the inbox level,
   the inbox is said to be full and cannot accept more messages at this level.
   This limitation is meant to ensure that Merkle proofs about the inbox
   contents have a bounded size. (See next section.)

   {1 Merkelization of the inbox}

   As for the state of the {!Sc_rollup_PVM_sig}, the layer 1 does not
   have to store the entire inbox but only a compressed form
   (typically a low number of hashes) that witnesses its contents, so
   that the protocol can check the validity of a proof about its contents.
   This saves space in the context of the layer 1 and is sufficient for the
   layer 1 to provide a source of truth about the contents of the
   inbox at the current level.

   {1 A level-indexed chain of inboxes}

   By design, inboxes are logically indexed by Tezos levels. This is
   required to have a simple way to decide if two commitments are in
   conflict. (See {!Sc_rollup_storage}.)

   A commitment included in the block at level L describes the effect
   of the messages of the inboxes with a level between a starting
   level L_0 and a stopping level L_1, both strictly inferior to
   L. The level L_0 must be the inbox level of its parent
   commitment.

   To be valid, a commitment needs to prove that it is reading
   messages from an inbox which is consistent with the inbox at level
   L stored in the layer 1 context. So, it should be possible at any
   time to build a proof that a given inbox is a previous version at
   level L_1 of the inbox found at level L: these are called inclusion
   proofs.

   {1 Clients}

   This module is meant to be used both by the protocol and by the
   rollup node in order to maintain consistent inboxes on both sides.
   These two clients slightly differ on the amount of information they
   store about the inbox.

   On the one hand, to reduce the space consumption of rollups on the
   chain storage, the protocol only stores metadata about the
   inbox. The messages' hash of the current level are kept in memory during
   block validation only (See {!Raw_context.Sc_rollup_in_memory_inbox}).
   By contrast, the messages of the previous levels are not kept in
   the context at all. They can be retrieved from the chain
   history though. However, being absent from the context, they are
   not accessible to the protocol.

   On the other hand, the rollup node must keep a more precise inbox
   to be able to produce Merkle proofs about the content of specific
   messages, at least during the refutation period.

   To cope with the discrepancy of requirements in terms of inbox
   storage while preserving a consistent Merkelization
   between the protocol and the rollup node, this module exposes the
   functions used to merkelize the inbox with an history (See
   {!History_bounded_repr.t}) as parameters to remember.

*)

module Hash : S.HASH with type t = Smart_rollup.Inbox_hash.t

module Skip_list : Skip_list.S

module V1 : sig
  type level_proof = {
    hash : Sc_rollup_inbox_merkelized_payload_hashes_repr.Hash.t;
    level : Raw_level_repr.t;
  }

  (** A [history_proof] is a [Skip_list.cell] that stores multiple
    hashes. [Skip_list.content history_proof] gives the hash of this cell,
    while [Skip_list.back_pointers history_proof] is an array of hashes of
    earlier [history_proof]s in the inbox.

    On the one hand, we think of this type as representing the whole
    Merkle structure of an inbox at a given level---it is the part of
    {!t} above that can actually be used to prove things (it cannot be
    forged by a malicious node because it much match the hash stored by
    the L1).

    On the other hand, we think of this type as representing a single
    proof-step back through the history of the inbox; given a hash that
    appears at some point later in the inbox this type proves that that
    hash points to this particular combination of a witness and further
    back-pointers.

    In terms of size, this type is a small set of hashes; one for the
    current witness and `O(log2(ix))` in the back-pointers, where [ix]
    is the index of the cell in the skip list. That is, [ix] is the
    number of non-empty levels between now and the origination level of
    the rollup.
  *)
  type history_proof = (level_proof, Hash.t) Skip_list.cell

  (** The type of the inbox for a smart-contract rollup as stored
      by the protocol in the context. Values that inhabit this type
      only act as fingerprint for inboxes and contain:
      - [level] : the inbox level ;
      - [old_levels_messages] : a witness of the inbox history.
  *)
  type t = {level : Raw_level_repr.t; old_levels_messages : history_proof}

  (** [inbox_level inbox] returns the maximum level of message insertion in
      [inbox] or its initial level. *)
  val inbox_level : t -> Raw_level_repr.t

  (** A [History.t] is basically a lookup table of {!history_proof}s. We
      need this if we want to produce inbox proofs because it allows us
      to dereference the 'pointer' hashes in any of the
      [history_proof]s. This [deref] function is passed to
      [Skip_list.back_path] or [Skip_list.search] to allow these
      functions to construct valid paths back through the skip list.

      A subtlety of this [history] type is that it is customizable
      depending on how much of the inbox history you actually want to
      remember, using the [capacity] parameter. In the L1 we use this with
      [capacity] set to zero, which makes it immediately forget an old
      level as soon as we move to the next. By contrast, the rollup node
      uses a history that is sufficiently large to be able to take part
      in all potential refutation games occurring during the challenge
      period. *)

(** [add_all_messages history inbox messages] starts a new inbox level,

    Remembers everything needed in a created [payloads_history] and [history].
    It is meant to be used by the rollup-node to reduce the risk of
    de-synchronisation between the protocol and the node.

    Adds the messages pushed by the protocol and returns a list of messages
    including them. The caller will need to execute this list of messages,
    otherwise, it might miss some internal inputs.

(** Used at the beginning of a refutation game to create the
    snapshot against which proofs in that game must be valid.

    One important note:
    It takes the snapshot of the inbox for the current level. The snapshot
    points to the inbox at the *beginning* of the current block level. This
    prevents to create a mid-level snapshot for a refutation game if new
    messages are added before and/or after in the same block. *)
val take_snapshot : t -> history_proof

(** An inbox proof has three parameters:

    - the [starting_point], of type [Raw_level_repr.t * Z.t], specifying
      a location in the inbox ;

    - the [message], of type [Sc_rollup_PVM_sig.input option] ;

    - and a reference [snapshot] inbox.

    A valid inbox proof implies the following semantics: beginning at
    [starting_point] and reading forward through [snapshot], the first
    message you reach will be [message].

    Usually this is fairly simple because there will actually be a
    message at the location specified by [starting_point]. But in some
    cases [starting_point] is past the last message within a level,
    and then the inbox proof's verification assumes that the next input
    is the SOL of the next level, if not beyond the snapshot.
