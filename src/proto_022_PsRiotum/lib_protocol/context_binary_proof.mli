type error += Expected_binary_proof

(** [is_binary proof] will fail if [proof] does not claim to be a
    Merkle proof of a binary tree compatible with the one defined in
    [Context_binary].

    {b Note:} It is very important to systematically check this before
    calling the [verify_proof] exposed in the protocol, since this
    function does not discriminate between binary and 32-ary
    proofs. *)
