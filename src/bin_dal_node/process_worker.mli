(** [run f arg] will run the function [f] : input_channel output_channel arg,

    between the parent and the child. The [f] function is expected to read and
    write on the provided unix pipes. The returned value is a process manager
    containing the other pipe ends, on which read_message and write_message can
    be used.
    As of now, only one reader and one writer are supported. There is not yet
    a locking mechanism and lwt channels are publicly accessible.
    On parent termination, a sigterm signal is sent to the child process,
    triggering a Lwt.cancel of the [f] function.
