Context library for storing ledger and operations on disk and in memory

## API Documentation

<https://tezos.gitlab.io/api/odoc/_html/octez-libs/Tezos_context/index.html>

## Overview

There are two containers that are used to store different things. The reunion of the two is called the [storage](http://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/storage.html). It can be described rapidly like this:

- storage
  - `store`
    - contains the blocks
  - `tezos-context` (brassaia)
    - ledger
    - contains the state of every account and their updates

`tezos-context` provides an abstraction over the ledger storage (be it on disk and in memory).

## Implementation details

Brassaia stores the context in memory and on disk. Both are created by calling the functor `Lib_context.Disk.Context.Make`. This functor takes an `Brassaia.Schema.Extended` as its parameter. The schema is composed of:
- `Hash`: used to hash anything
- `Branch`: used to represent a branch. *In Tezos branches are simple strings*.
- `Info`: used to represent the information about the commit (author, message, date etc.)
- `Contents`: used to represent the data stored (a file or blob). *In Tezos, these are bytes*.
- `Path`: a string list to represent a path in a `tree` of directory and files. *A string list in Tezos*.
- `Step`: the minimal component of a `Path`. *A string in Tezos*.
- `Metadata`: Not used in Tezos.
- `Commit`: Functor over `Node_key` and `Commit_key` to (*taken from `Brassaia.Libbrassaia.Commitintf`*) generalise the concept of **commit** to one that supports object keys that are not strictly equal to hashes. *Since Tezos applies it to nodes and commits which type is already know, this functor may be useless*.
- `Nodes`: used to represent a node in the `tree` (a directory). This is a functor over `keys` and `contents`. *It's still unclear what this does exactly*.

This will provide us with the following module architecture:
- An in-memory `tree` (the `Tree` module)
- An on-disk `store` (the main level functions)

### Common interface

Both the `store` and the `tree` are called **contexts** and share a common interface `Lib_context.Sigs.Context.VIEW`:
- `t`, `key`, `value`, `tree` are the types used by this view
- `mem`/`mem_tree` returns a boolean corresponding to the fact that a `key` is associated to a `value`/`tree` in a context
- `find`/`find_tree` will return a `value`/`tree` option associated to a `key` in a context
- `add`/`add_tree` will return a context where a `key` has been associated (or its association replaced) to a `value`/`tree`
- `remove` will remove a `key` from a context

### Tree

*It should be noted that `VIEW.t` and `VIEW.tree` are equal in `Tree`.*

The `Tree` defines functions that are useful for an in-memory context:

- `empty`, `is_empty` and `equal` are self explanatory ones and don't need to be explained
- `kind t` returns the fact that `t` is a node or a leaf
- `to_value t` returns `Some v` if `t` is a leaf and `v` is its value and `None` otherwise
- `of_value _ v` is a new leaf `tree v` *It could be called `singleton`*
- `hash t` is the Merkle hash of `t`
- `clear ?depth t` will clear all caches in `t` for subtrees of depth equal to `depth` or higher.

#### Remarks

Some functions are associated to `raw trees` that can be either a `Value of bytes` or a `Tree of raw String.Map.t`. This indicates that it is known in the functor that keys are `string` and values are `bytes` yet this is still hidden from the rest of the module. The functions associated to `raw trees` have not been analysed yet.

### Block-indexed `store`

The main type representing the `store` is `index`. It can be created by:
- the `index` function that takes a `context` (which is both the `tree` and the `index`, this function just extracts the `index` from the `context`)
- an `init` function. This function sets up some parameters like the indexing strategy, the LRU cache size, the root (as in: where it will be stored on disk) etc.

#### Common VIEW functions

Most of the functions implemented for VIEW will work on the `tree` stored in the `context` and will not touch the `store`.

#### Access to the disk

The modifications to the `tree` will be stored in the disk (the `store`) when the `commit` function is called. It will return the hash of the commit.

Brassaia implements what they call a *garbage collector*. In my (@mattiasdrp) opinion, this should not be called a GC because it will remove all the data older than a chosen commit. Accessing data older than this commit will be impossible even though the data younger is still pointing to it. Instead of calling it a GC it could be called a "commit pruner" or something else that indicates that the data are removed regardless of their liveness.

Other functions use the disk and need to be documented (some of them already are in `Lib_context.Sigs.Context`:
- `sync` synchronises the `context` with the `index`
- `split`: *not sure about what it does currently*
- `export_snapshot` exports a single commit as a standalone store (as I understand it, it is supposed to replay the commit history to have a file that represents the ledger and not the transaction history).
- `set_head`, `set_master`: self-explanatory git-like functions

### Important types

### Tezos configuration`

```ocaml
module Conf = struct
  let entries = 32
  let stable_hash = 256
  let contents_length_header = Some `Varint
  let inode_child_order = `Seeded_hash
  let forbid_empty_dir_persistence = true
end
```

### Context

```ocaml
type index = {
  path : string;
  repo : Store.Repo.t;
  patch_context : (context -> context tzresult Lwt.t) option;
  readonly : bool;
}

and context = {
  index : index;
  parents : Store.Commit.t list;
  tree : Store.tree;
  (* number of `remove`, `add_tree` and `add` calls, not yet flushed *)
  ops : int;
}
type t = context
```

### Summary

- The `Tezos_context` module (dispatched between `Lib_context.Sigs.Context`, `Lib_context.Memory.Context` and `Lib_context.Disk.Context` is the intermediary between Tezos and Brassaia
- Brassaia handles both a `Tree` (in-memory partial representation of the context) and an `index` (on-disk representation of the context that can be limited to the most recent commits)
- Most functions used in `Tezos_context` communicate with the `Tree` and are later reflected to the disk by using the `commit` function

As we saw, the main names are `Context` = `Tree` + `Index` yet Brassaia uses `Store` as an alias for `Context`. Whenever `Store` is seen, it needs to be understood as `Context`.

### Issues: Creating a Tezos context

The way a Tezos context (store) is created is convoluted:
- `Make` expects and `Encoding` of type `Tezos_context_encoding.Context`
- A `Store` is created:
  - by creating `Maker` which is the application of `Brassaia_pack_unix.Maker` to `Encoding.Conf`
  - `Maker.Make` is then applied to `Encoding.Schema`
  - `Schema` is aliased as `Tezos_context_encoding.Context.Schema`
  - `Store.Backend` is almost the same as the `Schema` where all functors have been applied to the relevant modules and some modules have been added.

Creating a `Maker` functor applied to a `Conf` and then applying it to a `Schema` when both are already known beforehand could (should?) be simplified.

**The main thing to understand from this is that a `Context` is created when given:
   - a `Conf` representing the parameters of the in-memory `tree`
   - a `Schema` listing all the internal representations (commits, nodes, contents etc.)**
