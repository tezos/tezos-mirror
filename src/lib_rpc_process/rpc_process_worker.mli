(** Worker that handles the RPC server spawned as an external process
   by the node.

   This module defines an RPC process worker type [t] that is
   responsible of dealing with the process' lifetime. *)

(** Type of the RPC process worker*)
type t

(** [create ~comm_socket_path config node_version internal_event_config] creates
    the worker initial state. [comm_socket_path] is a socket path that will be
    used to communicate with the node (note that the socket is created
    automatically, but the cleaning of it is not handled). [config] contains all
    the RPC server configuration (such as ACLs, cors_headers, â€¦). [node_version]
    contains informations regarding version of the node to show when answering
    related rpcs. *)

(** Starts the external RPC process using fork+exec calls. It
    implements a watch dog that is responsible of restarting the
    process if it dies at some point. Additionally, if the process
    fails to be restarted, it retries with an exponential back-off
    until the restart is successful.
    The promise is blocking until the RPC server is fully
    available to answer to RPCs. *)
