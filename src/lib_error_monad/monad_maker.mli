  (** [record_trace err res] is either [res] if [res] is [Ok _], or it is
      [Error (Trace.cons err tr)] if [res] is [Error tr].

      In other words, [record_trace err res] enriches the trace that is carried
      by [res] (if it is carrying a trace) with the error [err]. It leaves [res]
      untouched if [res] is not carrying a trace.

      You can use this to add high-level information to potential low-level
      errors. E.g.,

{[
record_trace
   Failure_to_load_config
   (load_data_from_file config_encoding config_file_name)
]}

      Note that [record_trace] takes a {e fully evaluated} error [err] as
      argument. It means that, whatever the value of the result [res], the error
      [err] is evaluated. This is not an issue if the error is a simple
      expression (a literal or a constructor with simple parameters). However,
      for any expression that is more complex (e.g., one that calls a function)
      you should prefer [record_trace_eval]. *)
  val record_trace : 'err -> ('a, 'err trace) result -> ('a, 'err trace) result

  (** [trace] is identical to [record_trace] but applies to a promise. More
      formally, [trace err p] is a promise that resolves to [Ok v] if [p]
      resolves to [Ok v], or it resolves to [Error (Trace.cons err tr)] if
      [res] resolves to [Error tr].

      In other words, [trace err p] enriches the trace that [p] resolves to (if
      it does resolve to a trace) with the error [err]. It leaves the value that
      [p] resolves to untouched if it is not a trace.

      You can use this to add high-level information to potential low-level
      errors.

      Note that, like {!record_trace}, [trace] takes a fully evaluated error as
      argument. For a similar reason as explained there, you should only use
      [trace] with simple expressions (literal or constructor with simple
      parameters) and prefer [trace_eval] for any other expression (such as ones
      that include functions calls). *)
  val trace :
    'err -> ('b, 'err trace) result Lwt.t -> ('b, 'err trace) result Lwt.t

  (** [record_trace_eval] is identical to [record_trace] except that the error
      that enriches the trace is wrapped in a function that is evaluated only if
      it is needed. More formally [record_trace_eval mkerr res] is [res] if
      [res] is [Ok _], or it is [Error (Trace.cons (mkerr ()) tr)] if [res] is
      [Error tr].

      You can achieve the same effect by hand with

{[
match res with
| Ok _ -> res
| Error tr -> Error (Trace.cons (mkerr ()) tr)
]}

      Prefer [record_trace_eval] over [record_trace] when the enriching error is
      expensive to compute or heavy to allocate. *)
  val record_trace_eval :
    (unit -> 'err) -> ('a, 'err trace) result -> ('a, 'err trace) result

  (** [trace_eval] is identical to [trace] except that the error that enriches
      the trace is wrapped in a function that is evaluated only if {e and when}
      it is needed. More formally [trace_eval mkerr p] is a promise that
      resolves to [Ok v] if [p] resolves to [Ok v], or it resolves to
      [Error (Trace.cons err tr)] if [p] resolves to [Error tr] and then [mkerr
      ()] resolves to [err].

      You can achieve the same effect by hand with

{[
p >>= function
| Ok _ -> p
| Error tr ->
   mkerr () >>= fun err ->
   Lwt.return (Error (Trace.cons err tr))
]}

      Note that the evaluation of the error can be arbitrarily delayed. Avoid
      using references and other mutable values in the function [mkerr].

      Prefer [trace_eval] over [trace] when the enriching error is expensive to
      compute or heavy to allocate or when evaluating it requires the use of
      Lwt. *)

  (** [unless b f] is [f ()] if [b] is [false] and it is a promise already

      You can use [unless] to avoid having to write an [if] statement that you
      then need to populate entirely to satisfy the type-checker. E.g, you can
      write [unless b f] instead of [if not b then f () else return_unit]. *)
