(** Storage reconstruction

    The storage reconstruction feature aims to re-compute the contexts
    (ledger state) and the blocks metadata of a full mode storage, and
    thus, migrate a storage from a full history mode to an archive
    one.

    To do so, it is needed to re-validate the whole chain, by applying
    (using the standard validation method:
    {!Tezos_validation.Block_validation.apply}) all the blocks from the
    genesis on empty context. As a storage running a full history mode
    will not store all the ledger state but keeps all the blocks (and
    operations), it is the only mode that can be reconstructed. The
    operation consist of two major steps:
    - Reconstructing the cemented block store: for each cemented cycle,
    the context of each block along with their associated metadatas
    are restored.
    - Reconstructing the floating block stores: this step is only
    necessary if the store was recently imported from a snapshot as
    some metadata will be missing.

    As the reconstruction procedure changes the state of the storage,
    it cannot be run while a node is running on the storage to
    reconstruct. If the reconstruction is interrupted, it will be
    resumed if restarted.
