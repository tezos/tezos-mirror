(** Snapshots for the store

    Snapshots are canonical representations of the store and its
    associated context. Its main purposes it to save and load a
    current state with the minimal necessary amount of
    information. This snapshot may also be shared by third parties to
    facilitate the bootstrap process.

    A snapshot of a block [B] is composed of :
    - The snapshot format version (see [version]), as a file;
    - The metadata of the snapshot (see [metadata]), as a file;
    - Some data to ensure snapshot consistency at import (see
      [block_data]), as a file;
    - A single context containing every key that the block [B-1] needs
      (see below), as a file;
    - The set of (cemented and floating) blocks and their operations
      from the genesis block up to [B] -- it might contain less blocks
      if the snapshot is created from a store using a [Rolling]
      history mode of if it is created as a [Rolling]
      snapshot. Block's metadata are not exported. The cemented blocks
      are exported as a directory containing cycles as files, as well
      as some indexing data. The floating blocks are stored as a
      single file ;
    - The set of necessary Tezos protocols, as a directory containing
      the protocols as single files.

    There are two kinds of snapshot formats that can be exported:
    - [Raw] is a directory containing the aforementioned data as
    independent files;
    - [Tar] is a tar archive containing all the data as a single
    archive file. To achieve better performances while loading the
    snapshot's information (version and metadata), we store first the
    version and then the metadata, to avoid seeking through the whole
    file.

    Importing a snapshot will initialize a fresh store with the data
    contained in the snapshot. As snapshots may be shared between
    users, checks are made to ensure that no malicious data is
    loaded. For instance, we export the context of block [B-1] to make
    sure that the application of the block [B], given its
    predecessor's context, is valid.

    Depending on the history mode, a snapshot might contain less
    blocks. In full, all blocks are present and importing such a
    snapshot will populate the {!Cemented_store} with every cycle up
    to the snapshot's target block. Meanwhile, in [Rolling], only a
    few previous blocks will be exported ([max_op_ttl] from the target
    block), only populating a {!Floating_block_store}. Thus, the
    snapshot size greatly differs depending on the history mode used.

    Snapshots may be created concurrently with a running node. It
    might impact the node for a few seconds to retrieve the necessary
    consistent information to produce the snapshot.
