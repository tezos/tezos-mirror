(** Persistent block store with linear history

    The cemented block store is a store where blocks are stored
    linearly (by level) in chunks. Blocks in this store should not be
    reorganized anymore and are thus *cemented*. As these blocks
    should not be accessed regularly and especially their optionally
    stored metadata, the later are compressed using a zip format to
    save disk space. For each chunk of blocks, a dedicated file is
    used. Moreover, to enable easy access and to prevent too much
    on-disk reading, two indexed maps are used to retrieve blocks hash
    from their level and their level from the block hash.

    The cemented block store contains a set of files updated each time
    a new chunk is added to the store. These files indicate which
    interval of blocks (w.r.t. their levels) are stored in it.

    {1 Invariants}

    This store is expected to respect the following invariants:

    - A key/value present in an index is present as well in the other
      as value/key.

    - Every block stored is correctly referenced through its
      associated indexes.

    - A cemented chunk of blocks that is represented by the interval
      [ i ; j ] (with i <= j) contains | j - i + 1 | blocks and are
      ordered from i to j in the file.

    - The set F of cemented chunks is always ordered by block level.

    - The cemented store does not contain holes: let F be the cemented
      chunks, if |F| > 1 then:

{v
      ∀f_x=(i,j) ∈ F ∧ x < |F|, ∃f_y =(i', j'), x = y - 1 ∧ j + 1 = j'
v}

      meaning the concatenation of every chunk must be continuous.

    - A metadata zip file is indexed by the same interval as the
      chunks and, when it is the lowest chunk of metadata stored, is
      not assured to contain every block's metadata of the chunk.

    {1 Files format}

    The cemented block store is composed of the following files:

    - file: /<i_j>, a chunk of blocks from level i to level j. The
      format of this file is:

    | <n> × <offset> | <n> × <block> |

    where n is (j - i + 1), <offset> is a 8 bytes integer representing
    the absolute offset of a block where the k-th (with 0 <= k < n)
    offset stands for the absolute offset of the k-th block in the
    file and with <block>, a {!Block_repr.t} value encoded using
    {!Block_repr.encoding} (thus prefixed by the its size).

    - dir: /cemented_block_index_level, the Hash -> Level key/value
      index ;

    - dir: /cemented_block_index_hash, the Level -> Hash key/value
      index.

    - dir: /metadata, the directory containing chunks of compressed
      metadata (present if relevant).

    - files: /metadata/<i_j>.zip, the compressed metadata where every
      chunk of block's metadata is indexed by their level encoded as
      string (present if relevant). *)
