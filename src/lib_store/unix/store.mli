(** Store abstraction over the disk storage. *)

(**
   {2 Description}

   This component handles the on-disk storage of static objects such
   as blocks, operations, block's metadata, protocols and chain data.
   The store also handle the chain's current state: current head,
   invalid blocks, active testchains, ...

   {2 Concurrency}

   This module is designed to handle concurrent accesses to the
   store. Data-races and deadlocks might still happen through the use
   of potential dangerous calls that are documented as such. Both a
   mutex and a lockfile are present to handle concurrent accesses at
   process levels.

   {2 Context handling}

   The store manages the context and thus handles the context
   initialization through {!Lib_context.Context.init}. This is done,
   among others reasons, for a consistency checking when storing a
   block. The store never commits a context on-disk.

   {2 History mode handling}

   This store handles the three different
   {!Tezos_base.History_mode.t}:

   - Archive: maintains every block that is part of the chain
     including their metadata.

   - Full <offset>: maintains every block that is part of the chain
     but prune the metadata for blocks that are below the following
     threshold level: [last_preserved_block_level] of the current head
     - [offset] cycles.

   - Rolling <offset>: maintains rolling windows which contain recent
     blocks that are part of the chain, along with their metadata. It
     prunes everything that is below the following threshold level:
     [last_preserved_block_level] of the current head - [offset]
     cycles.

   {2 Protocol store}

   The store has a global protocol store which may be shared by
   different chain stores.

   {2 Chain stores and merging}

   The store has a toplevel chain store which is called the
   [main_chain_store] and which can be accessed through the store's
   interface. It is either created if the associated directory is not
   present or loaded if it was previously created. This
   [main_chain_store] is able to recursively spawn testchains which
   are also chain stores. Those testchains are also recursively able
   to spawn their own testchains.

   Each chain store possesses its own block store and therefore its
   own historic. It also maintains a state throughout its run which is
   composed of:

   - [current_head]: the current head of the chain.

   - [target]: the optional block for which the chain must pass. The
     store will not allow to store blocks past this target's block if
     they are not its successors.

   - [checkpoint]: the block that represents the no fork point level:
     blocks that are below this block are discarded.

   - [savepoint]: the block that represents the lowest block with
     metadata in the chain.

   - [caboose]: the block that represents the lowest block known in the
     chain (with or without metadata).

    More details and invariants on these points are provided in the
   {!Chain} module description below.

    When a block is promoted as head of the chain (through
   {!Chain.set_head}) the following happens:

   - A check is made if this head is consistent (i.e. if it's not
     below the checkpoint);

   - If the [last_preserved_block_level] of the head is different from
     the previous head's one, then we can establish that a cycle has
     been completed and we can start cementing this cycle by
     "triggering a merge".

   A merge phase consists of establishing the interval of blocks to
   cement, which is trivially [last_preserved_block_level(new_head)]
   to [last_preserved_block_level(prev_head)], but also, for Full and
   Rolling history modes, keep some extra blocks so that we make sure
   to keep blocks above
   max_operation_ttl(last_preserved_block_level(checkpoint)). This is
   done to make sure that we can export snapshots at the checkpoint
   level later on. This merging operation is asynchronous, the changes
   will be committed on disk only when the merge succeeds. Before
   that, we only retain the changes in RAM so we may keep storing new
   blocks without blocking. If the process crashes while a merge is
   happening, the state is reloaded before the merging point. More
   details are given in {!Chain.set_head}.

   {2 Files hierarchy}

   The store directory is organized as follows:

   - /<protocol_dir>/ the directory containing stored protocols

   - /<protocol_dir>/<protocol_hash_b58>* files containing the encoded
     protocol.

   - /<chain_id_b58>/ the [chain_store_dir] directory containing the
     main chain store.

   [chain_store_dir] is a symbol for all chain stores directory
   hierarchy.

   - [chain_store_dir]/<lock> the lockfile.

   - [chain_store_dir]/<config.json> the chain store's configuration
     as a JSON file.

   - [chain_store_dir]/<block_store> contains every file mentioned in
     {!Block_store}'s format.

   - [chain_store_dir]/<stored_data>* files containing encoded simple
     data structures such as: genesis block, checkpoint, savepoint,
     caboose, protocol levels, forked chains, alternate heads, invalid
     blocks, etc.

   - [chain_store_dir]/testchains/<testchain_id_b58>/ contains the
     [chains_store_dir]'s test chain, based on a similar hierarchy.

(** {3 Initialization} *)

(** [init ?patch_context ?commit_genesis ?history_mode ?readonly
    ?block_cache_limit ?disable_context_pruning ?maintenance_delay
    ~store_dir ~context_dir ~allow_testchains genesis] initializes the
    store and a main chain store. If [store_dir] (resp. [context_dir])
    does not exist, a fresh store (resp. context) is
    created. Otherwise, it loads the store (resp. context) from
    reading the adequate directory. If [allow_testchains] is passed,
    the store will be able to fork chains and instantiate testchain's
    sub chain stores, for all chains contained in the store. The chain
    store created is based on the [genesis] provided. Its chain
    identifier will be computed using the {!Chain_id.of_block_hash}
    function.

    @param patch_context the handle called when initializing the
    context. It usually is passed when creating a sandboxed chain.

    @param commit_genesis overrides the default initial genesis commit
    when the node is created. This is used for when the context must be
    in readonly (e.g. started by an external validator) and we want to
    prevent writing in the context. {b Warning} passing this argument
    will initialize the context in readonly.
      Default: {!Context.commit_genesis} is called with [genesis]

    @param history_mode the history mode used throughout the store. If
    a directory already exists and the given [history_mode] is
    different, the initialization will fail.
      Default: {!History_mode.default} (which should correspond to
    full with 5 extra preserved cycles.)

    @param readonly a flag that, if set to true, opens the storage,
      that is stored on disk, in read-only mode preventing to write in
      the corresponding store {b and} context.
      Default: false

    @param block_cache_limit allows to override the size of the block
    cache to use. The minimal value is 1.

    @param disable_context_pruning a flag that, if set to true,
      prevent the store to trigger the context pruning. Note that the
      storage maintenance, aka merge, won't be impacted by this flag.
      Default: false

    @param maintenance_delay a flag that, if set, will disable the
    storage maintenance by a certain delay.
      Default: Disabled

  (** [checkpoint chain_store] returns the checkpoint associated to

      The checkpoint is a block descriptor
      ({!Store_types.block_descriptor}) pointing to a block that must be
      part of the chain. The checkpoint maintains the set of following
      invariants:

      - The store will only accept blocks that are above its
        checkpoint's level.

      - The checkpoint is updated periodically such that the following
      invariant holds:
      [checkpoint.level >= all_head.last_preserved_block_level]

      The checkpoint will tend to designate the highest block among
      all chain head's [last_preserved_block_level] in a normal
      mode. This is not always true. i.e. after a snapshot import
      where the checkpoint will be set as the imported block and when

      future block that must be reached by the chain. When a block is
      received, if its level is equal to the target's block level then
      its hash must be also be the same. Otherwise, the block is
      considered as invalid and will be discarded.

      The target should only be set manually. Whenever the target

      following invariant:

      [is_stored(block) \and has_metadata(block) => block.level >=
      savepoint.level]

      For Full and Rolling history modes, the savepoint will be
      periodically updated at each store merge which happens when:

      [pred(head).last_preserved_block_level <
      head.last_preserved_block_level]

      block that we know present in the chain store, if the history
      mode is {b not} Archive, it might not contain its metadata
      depending on the current savepoint:

  (** [set_head chain_store block] promotes the [block] as head of the
      [chain_store] and triggers an asynchronous store merge if a
      cycle is ready to be cemented. Triggering a merge will update
      the savepoint, checkpoint and caboose consistently with the
      [chain_store]'s history mode. This function returns the previous
      head. Setting a new head will fail when the block is not fit to
      be promoted as head (i.e. too old or no metadata).

      After a merge:

      - The checkpoint is updated to [lpbl(new_head)] if it was below
        this level or unchanged otherwise;

      - The savepoint will be updated to :
        min(max_op_ttl(lpbl(new_head)), lpbl(new_head) - <cycle_length>
        * <history_mode_offset>) or will remain 0 in Archive mode;

      - The caboose will be updated to the same value as the savepoint
        in Rolling mode.

      Note: lpbl(new_head) is the last preserved block level of the
      new head.

      {b Warnings:}

      - We expect blocks to be sequentially promoted as head using
        this function;

      - If a merge is triggered while another is happening, this
        function will block until the first merge is resolved. *)
