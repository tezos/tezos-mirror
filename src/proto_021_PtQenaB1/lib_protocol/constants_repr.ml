   To avoid attacks through too large proofs and long decoding times on public

   to [30Kb].

   Even if the operation size limit is currently [32Kb] (see
   {!Constants_repr.max_operation_data_length}) the node's mempool can still
   be spammed with larger proofs before detecting that the operations are
   indeed larger than the limit.

   By design, the proofs should be created and verified for a single tick
   which should limit the number of read/writes in the Merkle tree, and thefore,
   limit the total size of a proof. Thus, [30Kb] can be lowered once we
   have empirically observed that a valid proof can not be that large.

   Note that an encoded proof that is [30Kb] might still be not included
   in a valid L1 operation. The refutation operation also contains other
   information such as an inbox proof. We only put here an upper bound
   for the size.
