(** Bounded queues combined with hash-tables, based on {!Aches}.

    A {e hash queue} is a structure where one can add elements to the back of
    the queue, while associating them to keys. This allows for efficiently
    retrieving elements based on the key and for removing elements anywhere in
    the queue.
