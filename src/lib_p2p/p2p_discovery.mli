(** Local peer discovery.

    This module manages the discovery of local peers through UDP broadcasting.
    It is composed of two workers:
    - The sender worker whose role is to broadcast discovery messages.
    - The answer worker whose role is to listen discovery messages and register new
      peers in the current pool.
    Discovery messages are composed of an arbitrary key, the listening port and
    the peer id of the current peer.
*)

(** Type of a discovery worker. *)
type t

(** [create ~listening_port ~discovery_port ~discovery_addr pool peer_id]
    returns a discovery worker registering local peers to the [pool]
    and broadcasting discovery messages with the [peer_id] and
    the [listening_port] through the address [discovery_addr:discovery_port]. *)

val activate : t -> unit

(** [wakeup t] sends a signal to the sender machine of [t], asking it
    to immediately proceed to broadcasting. *)

(** [shutdown t] returns when [t] has completed shutdown. *)
