(** P2P maintenance worker.

    This worker enforces the connection bounds defined on the command-line
    or/and the configuration file.

    The maintenance process is launched:
    . When any of the following future  is resolved
        [P2p_trigger.wait_too_few_connections]
        [P2p_trigger.wait_too_many_connections]
    . When [maintain] is called
    . After [maintenance_idle_time] if none of the other conditions have been
      met.

    If the number of connections is above the limit, the maintainer
    kills existing connections.

    If below the limit, it tries to connect to points available from [P2p_pool].
    If not enough connections can be obtained, it requests new points from
    [P2p_pool] using [P2p_pool.broadcast msg], and wakes up the
    [P2p_discovery] worker. It then waits for new peers or points by waiting
    on futures
      [P2p_trigger.wait_new_peer]
      [P2p_trigger.wait_new_point]
    This is reiterated indefinitely every [require_new_points_time]. *)
