(** Typed and encrypted connections to peers.

    This module defines:
    - primitive functions to implement a session-establishment protocol
      (set up an authentication/encryption symmetric session key,
       check proof of work target, authenticate hosts, exchange metadata),
    - a higher-level, authenticated and encrypted, type of connection.

    It is parametric in two (abstract data) types. ['msg] is the unit of
    communication. ['meta] is a type of message sent in session establishment.

    Connections defined in this module wrap a [P2p_io_scheduler.connection]
    (which is simply a file descriptor on which R/W are regulated.)

    Each connection has an associated internal read (resp. write) queue
    containing messages (of type ['msg]), whose size can be limited by
    providing corresponding arguments to [accept]. *)

(** {1 Types} *)

(** Type of a connection that successfully passed the authentication
    phase, but has not been accepted yet. Parametrized by the type
    of expected parameter in the `ack` message. *)
type 'meta authenticated_connection

(** Type of an accepted connection, parametrized by the type of
    messages exchanged between peers. *)
type ('msg, 'meta) t

(** [equal t1 t2] returns true iff the identities of the underlying
    [P2p_io_scheduler.connection]s are equal. *)
val equal : ('mst, 'meta) t -> ('msg, 'meta) t -> bool

val pp : Format.formatter -> ('msg, 'meta) t -> unit

val info : ('msg, 'meta) t -> 'meta P2p_connection.Info.t

(** [local_metadata t] returns the metadata provided when calling
    [authenticate]. *)
val local_metadata : ('msg, 'meta) t -> 'meta

(** [remote_metadata t] returns the remote metadata, communicated by the
    remote host when the session was established. *)
val remote_metadata : ('msg, 'meta) t -> 'meta

val private_node : ('msg, 'meta) t -> bool

(** {1 Session-establishment functions}

    These should be used together
    to implement the session establishment protocol. Session establishment
    proceeds in three synchronous, symmetric, steps. The first two steps are
    implemented by [authenticate]. The third step is implemented by either [accept]
    or [nack].

    1. Hosts send each other an authentication message. The message contains
       notably a public key, a nonce, and proof of work stamp computed from
       the public key. PoW work is checked, and a session key is established
       (authenticated key exchange). The session key will be used to
       encrypt/authenticate all subsequent messages over this connection.

    2. Hosts send each other a ['meta] message.

    3. Each host send either an [Ack] message ([accept] function) or an [Nack]
       message ([nack] function). If both hosts send an [Ack], the connection
       is established and they can start to read/write ['msg].

    Note that [P2p_errors.Decipher_error] can be raised from all functions
    receiving messages after step 1, when a message can't be decrypted.

    Typically, the calling module will make additional checks after step 2 to
    decide what to do in step 3. For instance, based on network version or
    ['meta] information. *)

(** [authenticate canceler pow incoming conn point ?port identity version meta]
    returns a couple [(info, auth_conn)] tries to set up a session with
    the host connected via [conn].

    Can fail with
    - [P2p_errors.Not_enough_proof_of_work] if PoW target isn't reached
    - [P2p_errors.Myself] if both hosts are the same peer
    - [P2p_errors.Connection_closed] if the remote peer closes the connection *)
