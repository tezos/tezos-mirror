(** [process_head plugin node_ctxt ctxt ~predecessor head (inbox, messages)]
    interprets the [messages] associated with a [head] (where [predecessor] is
    the predecessor of [head] in the L1 chain). This requires the [inbox] to be
    updated beforehand. It returns [(ctxt, num_messages, num_ticks, tick)] where
    [ctxt] is the updated layer 2 context (with the new PVM state),
    [num_messages] is the number of [messages], [num_ticks] is the number of
    ticks taken by the PVM for the evaluation and [tick] is the tick reached by
    the PVM after the evaluation. *)

    state without any patches applied. [s2] is meant to be used to compute the
    genesis commitment. If there are no unsafe patches for the rollup [s2] is

    returns [None]. If provided, the evaluation is resumed from
