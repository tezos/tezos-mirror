(** Component for managing refutation games.
    This module is implemented as a single worker in the rollup node,
    which takes care of processing new L1 heads, and coordinating
    the refutation game players. (See {!Refutation_player}).
*)

(** Initiatilize the refuation coordinator, if the rollup node mode
    supports it. *)
val init : Node_context.rw -> unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** Whether the refutation coordinator is run in the given mode. *)
val start_in_mode : Configuration.mode -> bool

(** [process head] processes a new l1 head. This means that the coordinator
    will:
    {ol
      {li Gather all existing conflicts}
      {li Launch new refutation players for each conflict concerning
          the operator that doesn't have a player in this node}
      {li Kill all players whose conflict has disappeared from L1}
      {li Make all players play a step in the refutation}
    }
*)
val process : Layer1.head -> unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** Shutdown the refutation coordinator. *)
val shutdown : unit -> unit Lwt.t

(** Returns the status of the publisher worker. *)
