(** Originated contracts and tx rollups handles are crafted from the hash of the
    operation that triggered their origination (and nothing else). As a single
    operation can trigger several originations, the corresponding handles are
    forged from a deterministic sequence of nonces, initialized with the hash of
    the operation. *)
