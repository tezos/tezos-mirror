   Gas update and check for gas exhaustion
   =======================================

   Costs of various computations are subtracted from an amount of gas made
   available for the script execution.

   Updating the gas counter is a critical aspect to operation validation
   because it is done at many places.

   For this reason, the gas counter must be read and updated as quickly as
   possible. Hence, the gas counter should be stored in a machine register. To
   motivate the OCaml compiler to make that choice, we represent the gas counter
   as a local parameter of the execution [step] function.

*)

type local_gas_counter = Local_gas_counter of int [@@ocaml.unboxed]

(*

   The gas counter stored in the context is de-synchronized with the
   [local_gas_counter] used locally. When we have to call a gas-consuming
   function working on context with no local gas counter, we must update the
   context so that it carries an up-to-date gas counter. Similarly, when we
   return from such a function, the [local_gas_counter] must be updated as well.

   To statically track these points where the context's gas counter must be
   updated, we introduce a type for outdated contexts. The [step] function
   carries an [outdated_context]. When an external function needs a [context],
   the typechecker points out the need for a conversion: this forces us to
   either call [update_context], or better, when this is possible, the function
   [use_gas_counter_in_context].
