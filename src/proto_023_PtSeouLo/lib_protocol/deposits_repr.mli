(** Type representing unstaked frozen deposits.

    [initial_amount] is the amount on which slashing should be based.
    [current_amount] is the current amount after slashing has happened. 

    There is a record per cycle.

    The [initial_amount] may be increased during the current cycle only, when
    an unstake is requested.
