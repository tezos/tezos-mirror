(** The basic components of an optimistic rollup for smart-contracts. *)

(**

   An optimistic rollup for smart-contracts is made of two main
   components:

   - a proof generating virtual machine (PVM), which provides the
   essential semantics for the rollup operations to be validated by
   the layer 1 in case of dispute about a commitment ;

   - a database which maintains the cemented operations of the rollup
   as well as the potentially-disputed operations.

*)

  include module type of struct

    about the state of the PVM, which can be disputed as part of a commitment
    dispute.
