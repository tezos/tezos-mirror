(** A global size limit on the size of Micheline expressions

    We want to prevent constants from being

    if ever printed or sent over the network. We arrived at this
    number by finding the largest possible contract in terms of
    number of nodes. The number of nodes is constrained by the
    current "max_operation_data_length" (32768) to be ~10,000 (
    see "large_flat_contract.tz" in the tezt suite for the largest
    contract with constants that can be originated). As a first
    approximation, we set the node size limit to 5 times this amount. *)

(** The number of **full cycles** after a misbehaviour during which it
    can still be denounced.

    More precisely, the window for denouncing a misbehaviour that
    happens during cycle [n] spans from the misbehaviour itself until
    the end of cycle [n + denunciation_period]. So it indeed lasts
    [denunciation_period] full cycles plus part of cycle [n].

    (Technically, denunciations of the misbehaviour are actually
    allowed from the beginning of cycle [n], even on earlier levels
    than the misbehaviour's. But this is only relevant if someone
    crafts double blocks or consensus operations in the future for some
    reason. In practice, we expect misbehaviours to only happen around
    the time when the chain reaches their level, which is why we don't
    count cycle [n] itself as a full cycle for denouncing.)

    Note that we must have [denunciation_period >= 1], otherwise if a
    misbehaviour happens at the very last block of a cycle, there is no
    time frame to denounce it.

    Currently [denunciation_period = 1] which is considered enough
    time for all misbehaviours to be denounced.

    /!\ Several parts of the codebase may assume that
    [denunciation_period = 1] **without being parametrized using this
    constant**. So if it is ever modified, the codebase needs to be
    examined extensively; searching for places that use this constant
    is not enough. *)
val denunciation_period : int

(** The number of **full cycles** between a misbehaviour and its
    slashing (assuming that it has been denounced).

    That is, a misbehaviour that happens during cycle [n] is always
    slashed at the end of cycle [n + slashing_delay], regardless of
    when it has been denounced (and if it has not been denounced by
    then, then it is too late and it will never be slashed).

    Note that we must have [slashing_delay >= denunciation_period],
    otherwise the chain would accept denunciations for which the
    slashing can no longer happen because it is too late.

    Also note that to make the slashing possible, information on
    baking rights for cycle [n] needs to be kept in the context until
    the end of cycle [n + slashing_delay].

    /!\ Several parts of the codebase may assume that
    [slashing_delay = 1] **without being parametrized using this
    constant**. So if it is ever modified, the codebase needs to be
    examined extensively; searching for places that use this constant
    is not enough. *)
