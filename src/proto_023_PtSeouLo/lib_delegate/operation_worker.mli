(** The operation worker is responsible for listening to the node's mempool
    and collecting incoming operations in an accessible operation pool. Upon
    request, it can monitor the (pre)quorum status for a given payload and
    report its completion through the provided quorum stream.

    Only one payload quorum or prequorum can be monitored at a time; new
    monitoring requests override the previous one.
