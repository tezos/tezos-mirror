(* Each time a new head is received, the operation_pool field of the state is
   cleaned/reset by this function. Instead of emptying it completely, we keep
   the attestations of at most 5 rounds and 1 level in the past, to be able to
   include as much attestations as possible in the next block if this baker is
   the proposer. This allows to handle the following situations:

   - The baker observes an EQC for (L, R), but a proposal arrived for (L, R+1).
   After the flush, extra attestations on top of (L, R) are 'Branch_refused',
   and are not re-sent by the node. If the baker proposes at (L+1, 1), he should
   be able to include these extra attestations. Hence the cache for old rounds.

   - The baker receives a head at (L+1, 0) on top of (L, 0), but this head
   didn't reach consensus. If the baker who proposes at (L+1, 1) observed some
   extra attestations for (L, 0) that are not included in (L+1, 0), he may want
   to add them. But these attestations become 'Outdated' in the mempool once
   (L+1, 0) is received. Hence the cache for previous level.
