(** [prepare_block global_state block_to_bake] prepares a block by:
    - inferring the block timestamp

    - recovering the operations from the mempool if the block is a new proposal,
    or reusing the operations from [block_to_bake]'s payload if the block is a
    reproposal

    - generating the seed nonce hash if needed

    - setting the votes for liquidity baking and adaptive issuance according to the
    per_block_vote_file

    - calling [Block_forge.forge] to forge the block

    - signing the block header

    - registering the seed nonce if needed

    unauthorized consensus vote.*)

    forges a consensus operation by encoding the operation consensus content
