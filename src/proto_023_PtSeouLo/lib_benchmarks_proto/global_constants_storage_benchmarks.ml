   and [Global_constants_storage.Internal_for_tests.expr_to_address_in_context].
   The other main function exported by [Global_constants_storage] is [register];
   however, [register] calls [expand] and does little else, and thus does
   not need to be further carbonated.

   In the process of creating these benchmarks, we benchmarked several OCaml
   stdlib functions and [Script_expr_hash.of_b58check_opt]. While these cost
   models are not used in the protocol, they are kept here to ensure the

(** [Global_constants_storage.expand] traverses a Micheline node,
    searching for constants and replacing them with their values
    retrieved from storage.

    There are three branches in the iterations of [Global_constants_storage.expand]
    can take, each with different costs:
    - Branch 1: The first time a particular constant is found, the hash is parsed with
      [Script_expr_hash.of_b58check_opt], and its value is retrieved
      from storage. This storage call (implemented [Global_constants_storage.get])
      is already carbonated and dominates the cost in this case, so do not need to
      benchmark Branch 1 - the benchmarks for storage access are sufficient.
    - Branch 2: If the same constant is found a subsequent time, its value is looked up
      in a map. On testing we determined that the cost of [Script_expr_hash.of_b58check_opt]
      dominates the cost of this branch - the cost of an OCaml map lookup is O(log 2 n), and
      n has to be unreasonably large to catch up to the constant time cost of validating the
      hash.
    - Branch 3: When no constant is found, the cost is merely that of pattern matching
      and calling the continuation (similar to that of [Micheline.strip_locations]).

    Because we don't know the full size of node being traversed ahead of time (because they
    are retrieved from storage), it is impossible to calculate the full gas cost upfront.
    However, each time we find a new expression to traverse, we can calculate its size upfront
    and charge the cost of all Branch 3 cases. We can then do an additional charge for Branch 2
    each time we find a constant, and let storage handle charging for Branch 1.

    Below are models for Branch 2 and 3 respectively.

       On testing I observed that while the linear model was accurate
       for small numbers of nodes, after 1000 nodes the cost seems to increase more
       than linearly. I think I would have to fine tune the sampler to better test
       past this amount; however, I don't think it's necessary - to get large orders
       of nodes, you need to use constants, in which case the cost of
       [Script_expr_hash.of_b58check_opt] will dominate. A n*log(n) model seems
       accurate enough for the range of values tested.

    (** We benchmark this by generating a random Micheline expression without constants
        and calling [expand] on it. This causes the function to spend all its time in
        Branch 3. *)
