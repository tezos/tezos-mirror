(** Management of disk-format versions.

    [`V2] introduced the [*_v2] kinds and deprecated the [*_v1] ones. The
    upgrade of a pack file to [`V2] was done silently the first time a used
    pushed a [*_v2] entry to the pack file.

    [`V3] introduced the control file. It centralizes all the metadata that used
    to be contained in the header of other files (e.g. the version of the store
    used to be stored in each files, it is now solely stored in the control
    file). The upgrade of a store to [`V3] was done silently when opening a
    store in rw mode.

    [`V4] introduced the chunked suffix. Upgrade from [`V3] happened on first
    write to the control file.

    [`V5] introduced the lower layer. Upgrade happened on first write to the
    control file. *)
