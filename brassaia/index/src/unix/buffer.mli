(** Extensible buffers with non-allocating access to the buffer's contents. *)

type t
(** The type of buffers. *)

val create : int -> t
(** [create n] is a fresh buffer with initial size [n]. *)

val length : t -> int
(** [length b] is the number of bytes contained in the buffer. *)

val is_empty : t -> bool
(** [is_empty t] iff [t] contains 0 characters. *)

val clear : t -> unit
(** [clear t] clears the data contained in [t]. It does not reset the buffer to
    its initial size. *)

val add_substring : t -> string -> off:int -> len:int -> unit
(** [add_substring t s ~off ~len] appends the substring
    [s.(off) .. s.(off + len - 1)] at the end of [t], resizing [t] if necessary. *)

val add_string : t -> string -> unit
(** [add_string t s] appends [s] at the end of [t], resizing [t] if necessary. *)

val write_with : (string -> int -> int -> unit) -> t -> unit
(** [write_with writer t] uses [writer] to write the contents of [t]. [writer]
    takes a string to write, an offset and a length. *)

val blit : src:t -> src_off:int -> dst:bytes -> dst_off:int -> len:int -> unit
(** [blit] copies [len] bytes from the buffer [src], starting at offset
    [src_off], into the supplied bytes [dst], starting at offset [dst_off]. *)
