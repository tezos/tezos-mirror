    t
  (** The constructor for indexes.

      @param flush_callback
        A function to be called before any new bindings are persisted to disk
        (including both automatic flushing and explicit calls to {!flush} or
        {!close}).

        This can be used to ensure certain pre-conditions are met before
        bindings are persisted to disk. (For instance, if the index bindings are
        pointers into another data-structure [d], it may be necessary to flush
        [d] first to avoid creating dangling pointers.)
      @param cache used for instance sharing.
      @param fresh whether an existing index should be overwritten.
      @param read_only whether read-only mode is enabled for this index.
      @param throttle
        the strategy to use when the cache are full and and async in already in
        progress. [Block_writes] (the default) blocks any new writes until the
        merge is completed. [Overcommit_memory] does not block but continues to
        fill the (already full) cache.
      @param log_size the maximum number of bindings in the `log` IO.
      @param lru_size
        the maximum number of recently-read index bindings kept in memory.
        Defaults to 30_000. *)

  val clear : t -> unit
  (** [clear t] clears [t] so that there are no more bindings in it. *)

  val find : t -> key -> value
  (** [find t k] is the binding of [k] in [t]. *)

  val mem : t -> key -> bool
  (** [mem t k] is [true] iff [k] is bound in [t]. *)

  val replace : ?overcommit:bool -> t -> key -> value -> unit
  (** [replace t k v] binds [k] to [v] in [t], replacing any existing binding of
      [k].

      If [overcommit] is true, the operation does not triger a merge, even if
      the caches are full. By default [overcommit] is false. *)

  val filter : t -> (key * value -> bool) -> unit
  (** [filter t p] removes all the bindings (k, v) that do not satisfy [p]. This
      operation is costly and blocking. *)

  val iter : (key -> value -> unit) -> t -> unit
  (** Iterates over the index bindings. Limitations:

      - Order is not specified.
      - In case of recent replacements of existing values (since the last
        merge), this will hit both the new and old bindings.
      - May not observe recent concurrent updates to the index by other
        processes. *)

  val flush : ?no_callback:unit -> ?with_fsync:bool -> t -> unit
  (** Flushes all internal buffers of the [IO] instances.

      - Passing [~no_callback:()] disables calling the [flush_callback] passed
        to {!v}.
      - If [with_fsync] is [true], this also flushes the OS caches for each [IO]
        instance. *)

  val close : ?immediately:unit -> t -> unit
  (** Closes all resources used by [t], flushing any internal buffers in the
      instance.

      If [immediately] is passed, this operation will abort any ongoing
      background processes. This guarantees not to corrupt the store, but may
      require additional work to be done on the next startup. *)

  val sync : t -> unit
  (** [sync t] syncs a read-only index with the files on disk. Raises
      {!RW_not_allowed} if called by a read-write index. *)

  val is_merging : t -> bool
  (** [is_merging t] returns true if [t] is running a merge. Raises
      {!RO_not_allowed} if called by a read-only index. *)

  val merge : t -> unit
  (** [merge t] forces a merge for [t].

      If there is no merge running, this operation is non-blocking, i.e. it
      returns immediately, with the merge running concurrently.

      If a merge is running already, this operation blocks until the previous
      merge is complete. It then launches a merge (which runs concurrently) and
      returns. *)

  val try_merge : t -> unit
  (** [try_merge] is like {!merge} but is a no-op if the number of entries in
      the write-ahead log is smaller than [log_size]. *)
