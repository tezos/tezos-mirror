(** Index

    [Index] is a scalable implementation of persistent indices in OCaml.

    [Index] provides the standard key-value interface: [find], [mem] and
    [replace]. It requires three IO instances:

    - A `log` IO containing all of the recently-added bindings; this is also
      kept in memory.

    - When the `log` IO is full, it is merged into the `index` IO. Search is
      done first in `log` then in `index`, which makes recently added bindings
      search faster.

    - A `lock` IO to ensure safe concurrent access. *)
