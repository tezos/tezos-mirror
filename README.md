Tezos
=====

The Project
-----------

Tezos is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Tezos not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also attempts to come to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

 - Developer documentation is available online at http://tezos.gitlab.io/
   always in sync with the master branch (which may be desynchronized with
   the code running on the live networks).
 - The website https://tezos.com/ contains more information about the project.
 - All development happens on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos

The source code of Tezos is placed under the MIT Open Source License.
