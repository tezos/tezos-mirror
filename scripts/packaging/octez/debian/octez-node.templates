Template: octez-node/history-mode
Type: string
Default: full
Description: The type of node you wish to install
 - Full (default mode with 1 additional cycle). The node stores the minimal data
   since the genesis required to reconstruct (or ‘replay’) the complete chain’s
   ledger state.
 - Archive: This is the heaviest mode as it keeps the whole chain data to be able
   to query any information stored on the chain since the genesis.
   It is particularly suitable for indexers or block explorers.
 - Rolling: This is the lightest mode as it only maintains a minimal rolling
   fragment of the chain data so the node can still validate new blocks and
   synchronize with the head.
