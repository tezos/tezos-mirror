Description: L1 Octez node for the Tezos network
 This package serves as the core implementation for the Tezos blockchain node.
 It contains the fundamental components required for protocol execution,
 consensus, and network communication within the Tezos blockchain network
 .
 This package installs the Octez node.

Package: octez-client
Architecture: amd64 arm64
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends},
Description: Client for interacting with the Tezos blockchain
 This package serves as the client-side interface for interacting with the
 Tezos blockchain. It includes command-line tools and functionalities for
 querying blockchain data, broadcasting transactions, and interacting with
 smart contracts on the Tezos network.
 .
 This package installs the Octez client. For key management it is
 recommended to install a remote signer of a different host.
