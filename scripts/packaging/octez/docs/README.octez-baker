# Octez Baker

The octez baker should be configured to run along side a remote signer.

This package provides systemd services for both the baker and the accuser
and for the active and next protocol. For example, you can start the
baker using

```
$ sudo systemctl start octez-baker
```

All services are enabled but not started by default. It's up to the user
to configure them.

## Usage with a remote signer

The remote signer can be located either on the same machine, or better
on a separate machine and connected to a ledger.

This package does not make any assumption on how the final user will
configure its baker. We provide as an example some steps a user should
take to configure its baker service to communicate with a remote signer.

We assume, for the sake of brevity, that the signer is configured to
answer on a local http connection running on localhost and will use
authentication.

For example, assuming the octez-signer is already setup:
```
$ octez-signer show address alice
Hash: tz1V7TgBR52wAjjqsh24w8y9CymFGdegt9qs
Public Key: edpkvGAz71r8SZomcvF7LGajXT3AnhYX9CrmK3JWgA2xk8rf8CudY8

# Tell the baker about this signer
$ sudo su tezos -c "octez-client -R tcp://localhost:7732 config update"

# add the remote key to the baker
$ sudo su tezos -c "octez-client -R tcp://localhost:7732 import secret key alice remote:tz1V7TgBR52wAjjqsh24w8y9CymFGdegt9qs"

# Check that everything is ok
# you should see the the operation in the logs of the signer
# journalctl --user-unit octez-signer
$ sudo su tezos -c "octez-client sign bytes 0x03 for alice"

# Register your baking account
$ sudo su tezos -c "octez-client register key alice as delegate"
```
