# Build rust-sdk-bindings image for CI jobs and Octez docker distribution.

# Reads the following environment variables:
#  - 'rust_toolchain2_image_name'
#  - 'rust_sdk_bindings_image_tag' (optional)
#  - 'CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_PIPELINE_ID': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_PIPELINE_URL': set by GitLab CI

#  - 'CI_COMMIT_SHA': set by GitLab CI
#
# The image is tagged with $rust_sdk_bindings_image_name:REF_TAG and
# $rust_sdk_bindings_image_name:TAG. REF_TAG is a sanitized version of $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME.
# If $rust_sdk_bindings_image_tag is set, then TAG contains this value. If not, TAG contains
# a hash of this image's inputs.
#
# When running in the CI, $rust_sdk_bindings_image_tag is not set. The
# image is tagged with the input hash. In order for subsequent jobs to
# use the image built by this script, it stores the TAG in a dotenv
# file that is passed as artifacts to those jobs. By also tagging with
# the REF_TAG, we allow subsequent pipelines to refer to
# images built on a given branch, which is used for caching.
#
# When building the image, we get caches from
#  - $rust_sdk_bindings_image_name:REF_TAG and
#  - $rust_sdk_bindings_image_name:$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH.
# That is, from previous builds on the same branch and from previous
# builds on the master branch.
#
# The inputs of this image are the set of paths defined in
# 'images/rust-sdk-bindings/inputs'.
