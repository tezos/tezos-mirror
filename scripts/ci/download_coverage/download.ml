    "DOWNLOAD COVERAGE TRACES"
    ~description:
      {|Download coverage traces from a pipeline.

Example: to fetch coverage traces from
https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/pipelines/426773806, run
(from the root of the repository):

dune exec scripts/ci/download_coverage/download.exe -- --from 426773806

You can use the PROJECT environment variable to specify which GitLab
repository to fetch coverage traces from. Default is: tezos/tezos

The script can also be used to fetch coverage traces from the last successful pipeline on the
latest MR merged to the default branch (configurable through the DEFAULT_BRANCH
environment variable) for a given PROJECT:

dune exec scripts/ci/download_coverage/download.exe -- --from last-merged-pipeline
