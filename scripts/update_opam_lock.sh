This script updates opam/virtual/octez-deps.opam.locked.
This lock file contains the version number for all of Octez dependencies,
both direct and indirect. It does not include dev-only dependencies.

To produce this lock file, this scripts asks opam to use the commit:

  opam_repository_tag = $opam_repository_tag

from the public opam repository, to find a solution that is compatible
with opam/virtual/octez-deps.opam and opam/virtual/octez-dev-deps.opam.
Those two files are generated by the manifest
(see the documentation on profiles in manifest/manifest.mli).
Variable opam_repository_tag is defined in version.sh.

# Ideally we would just set the opam repository URL to
# https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository.git#$opam_repository_tag, but:
# - cloning the repo ourselves is actually significantly faster
#   (maybe opam does not know how to do a shallow clone);
# - this allows us to remove ocaml-system
#   (but we could also create the switch with --packages=ocaml-base-compiler.$ocaml_version);
# - this will allow us to remove other packages more easily in the future should we want to;
# - the --repositories argument of 'opam switch create' does not seem to understand
#   "url#tag", contrary to 'repository add'.
