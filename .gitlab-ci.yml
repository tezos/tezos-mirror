# The "manual" stage exists to fix a UI problem that occurs when mixing
# manual and non-manual jobs.
stages:
  - sanity
  - build
  - test
  - test_coverage
  - packaging
  - doc
  - build_release
  - publish_release
  - manual

# All the jobs belonging to a stage X should be in
# .gitlab/ci/X.yml. The stage "manual" is an exception to this rule,
# as jobs of that stage are not logically related.

# If the configuration for stage X is long, it can be broken up in
# subfiles .gitlab/ci/X/a.yml, .gitlab/ci/X/b.yml, etc (see e.g. the
# stage test).

# Finally, templates shall not be defined in one stage file and used
# in another. That is, a template defined in test.yml shall not be
# used in doc.yml (but it's fine to use it in a subfile test/X.yml).
