# Basic configuration to guard against double-pipelines
workflow:

    # This workflow entry does two things:
    # - it allows pipelines for push events (including force-push, push of fixup
    # commits, rebase, etc.)
    # - it allows pipelines for schedules events in which case it checks the
    # TZ_SCHEDULE_KIND which must be set in the pipeline scheduling interface
    # In either case it sets the TZ_PIPELINE_KIND variable to allow jobs to
    # selectively run on some pipelines but not all.
    # See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#workflow for additional
    # details.
