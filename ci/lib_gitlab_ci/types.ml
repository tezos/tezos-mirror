    - A [Pull] cache is pulled at the start of a job's execution, but is not pushed at its termination.

    caches. Jobs with [Push] caches only produce the caches. Jobs with

(** A matrix parallel job configuration.

    The matrix type allows to express how to run a job multiple times in
    parallel in a single pipeline, but with different variable values for each
    instance of the job. For example, a value of

    [[
      ("A", ["v1"; "v2"]);
      ("B"; ["v3"; "v4"]))
    ]]

    can be used to generate the following GitLab YAML:

    {{
    parallel:
      matrix:
        - A: ["v1","v2"]
          B: ["v3", "v4"]
    }}

    This will run 4 jobs with the associated variables [( v1,v3 ; v1,v4 ; v2;v3 ; v2;v4 )].

    See {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#parallelmatrix}parallel:matrix} in the
    GitLab YAML keyword reference for more information. *)
type matrix = (string * string list) list list

(** Parallelism configuration of a job.

    - [Vector n] will create [n] copies of the job.
    - [Matrix envs] will create one job per element in the
      cartesian product of the variable values domains for each
      environment. See {!matrix} for more details.

    See {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#parallel}parallel} in the GitLab
    YAML keyword reference for more information. *)

          instead to the key in the top-level that identifies the job. *)

          coverage field} is used to specify a regular expression that
          can be used to capture coverage information from the job's
          trace.  On the other hand, {!coverage_report} is used to
          expose the captured coverage information as a report in a
          job's artifacts
          ({{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportscoverage_report}ref}). *)

(** Parent-child downstream pipeline trigger.

    {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.html#parent-child-pipelines}
    Parent-child downstream pipelines} execute in the same project as
    the parent pipeline. They inherit the global variables of the
    parent pipeline. [trigger_include] should be a path to the
    definition of the child-pipeline.

    Be aware that the child pipeline must define a workflow that
    enables the jobs therein. Notably, the default workflow does not
    enable merge request pipelines, and thus the workflow for a child
    pipeline spawned by a merge request pipeline must include
    [workflow:] section with rules that also enables merge request
    pipelines.

    Note that except [trigger_include], the fields of a trigger job is
    a subset of those of a normal {!job} and share the same
    semantics. The fields supported by GitLab for trigger jobs are:

    - [allow_failure].
    - [extends].
    - [needs], but not [needs:project].
    - [only] and [except].
    - [rules].
    - [stage].
    - [trigger].
    - [variables].
    - [when] (only with a value of [on_success], [on_failure], or [always]).
    - [resource_group].
    - [environment].

    We currently only implement a subset of these, but more can be
    added as need arises. See
    {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#trigger}CI/CD YAML syntax
    reference} for more information. *)
type trigger_job = {
  name : string;
  stage : string option;
  when_ : when_trigger_job option;
  rules : job_rule list option;
  needs : need list option;
  trigger_include : string;
      (** Path to the child pipeline that the trigger will execute.

          Translates to [trigger:include:]. *)

type generic_job = Job of job | Trigger_job of trigger_job

  | Comment of string  (** Corresponds to a top-level YAML comment. *)

(** A GitLab CI/CD configuration.

    Note that a configuration can consists of a sequence of
    [config_element]s. The same element can occur multiple times, and
    their order has semantic significance (for instance, with [include:]). *)
