(* This module defines the jobs of the [master_branch] pipeline.

   This pipeline runs for each merge on the [master] branch. To goal
   of this pipeline is to publish artifacts for the latest development
   version of Octez (e.g. the latest version on 'master'), including:

   - docker images,
   - static binaries, and
   - documentation. *)

let jobs =
  (* Like in the {!Schedule_extended_test} variant of
     {!Code_verification} pipelines, we'd like to run as many jobs as
     possible in [master_branch] pipelines. Therefore, the default
     [when_] should be [Always] for jobs without dependencies.

     [changes:] clauses can be used on [master_branch] pipelines. In
     push pipelines like this one, [changes:]-clauses match against
     the diff of the branch's [HEAD] between two pushes. That is, the
     the difference between the previous state and the new state of
     the branch. In the case of the [master] branch, this is just the
     contents of the most recently merged MR. For more info on
     [changes:] in different pipelines, see
     {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_troubleshooting.html#jobs-or-pipelines-run-unexpectedly-when-using-changes}
