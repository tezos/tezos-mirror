(** {2 Pipeline types} *)

(* Register pipelines types. Pipelines types are used to generate
   workflow rules and includes of the files where the jobs of the
   pipeline is defined.

   Please add a [~description] to each pipeline.

   The first sentence of the description should be short (<=80
   characters), and be terminated by two new-lines. It should
   describe _what_ the pipeline does.

   The remainder of the description should detail:
   - what the pipeline does;
   - why we do it;
   - when it happens;
   - how;
   - and by whom it is triggered (a developer? a release manager? some automated system?). *)
