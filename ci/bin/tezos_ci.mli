      section that includes the set of jobs for the given pipeline. If

      automatically contains all the stages registered with
      {!Stage.register} that are used in the given pipeline.

      A [dummy_job] is written to the top-level configuration. This
      job is never enabled, but it works around a GitLab CI issue that
      occurs when the top-level configuration contains no visible
      jobs.

(** A facility for registering images for [image:] keywords.

    Images can be registered in two manners:
     - {i External} images are built outside the [tezos/tezos] CI and are
       registered with their path (e.g. [alpine:3.18]).

     - {i Internal} images are built in the pipeline they are
       used. They are registered an [image_path] and an
       [image_builder]. The [script:] of an [image_builder]
       must build the image and push it to [image_path].

    Pipelines with jobs using internal images automatically include
    corresponding image builder jobs with appropriate dependencies. *)
module Image : sig
  (** A registered Docker image in which a job can execute. *)
  type t

  (** Register an external image of the given [image_path]. *)
  val mk_external : image_path:string -> t

  (** Register internal image for [image_path] built by [image_builder_amd64].

      Optionally, a builder for an arm64 version of the image can be
      registered by supplying [image_builder_arm64]. If
      [image_builder_arm64] is supplied, then it must have a distinct
      name from [image_builder_amd64].

      Note: the name of the image builder(s) must uniquely identify the
      job definition. If two image builders with the same name but
      differing job definitions (as per polymorphic comparison of the
      underlying {!Gitlab_ci.Types.job}) are registered, then this
      function throws a run-time error. *)

(** A job dependency.

    - A job that depends on [Job j] will not start until [j] finishes.

    - A job that depends on [Optional j] will not start until [j]
    finishes, if it is present in the pipeline. For more information,
    see
    {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needsoptional}needs:optional}.

(** Job dependency sets.

    - A [Staged artifact_deps] job implements the default GitLab CI behavior of
      running once all jobs in the previous stage have terminated. Artifacts are
      downloaded from the list of jobs in [artifact_deps] (by default, no
      artifacts are downloaded).
    - An [Dependent deps] job runs once all the jobs in [deps] have terminated.
      To have a job run immediately, set [Dependent []]

    In practice, prefer using [Dependent]. Only use [Staged
    artifact_deps] when the number of dependencies exceed the GitLab
    imposed limit of 50 [needs:] per job. *)

val enc_git_strategy : git_strategy -> string

(** Define a job.

    This smart constructor for {!Gitlab_ci.Types.job} additionally:

    - Translates each {!dependency} to [needs:] and [dependencies:]
    keywords as detailed in the documentation of {!dependency}.
    - Adds [tag:] based on [arch] and [tag]:

      - If only [tag] is set, then it is passed as is to the job's [tags:]
        field. The runners of the tezos/tezos CI all use singleton tags,
        hence we only allow one tag per job.
      - Setting both [arch] and [tag] throws an error.
      - Omitting both [arch] and [tag] is equivalent to setting
        [~tag:Gcp] or, equivalently, omitting tag and setting
        [~arch:Amd64].

    - [image_dependencies] is a list of internal !{Image.t}s that this
      job uses indirectly, i.e. not in it's [image:] field. For
      instance, this can be used by a job that builds a Docker image
      with an internal image as input.  A run-time error will be thrown
      if this list includes an external image.

    - If the [image] used is {!Internal} and [tag] is set to
    {!Dynamic} then a run-time error is generated as the required
    architecture for the internal image cannot be statically
    deduced. *)
