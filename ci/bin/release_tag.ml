(* This module defines the jobs of the [release_tag] family of pipelines.

   These pipeline runs on each pushes to the various release tags (see
   [main.ml] for the set of regular expressions that define the
   language of release tags).

   The goal of these pipelines is to create
   {{:https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/releases}Octez releases on
   GitLab}, the associated artifacts, and to push releases to opam. *)

(** Type of release tag pipelines.

    The semantics of the type is summed up in this table:

   |                       | Release_tag | Beta_release_tag | Non_release_tag |
   |-----------------------+-------------+------------------+-----------------|
   | GitLab release type   | Release     | Release          | Create          |
   | Experimental binaries | No          | No               | No              |
   | Docker build type     | Release     | Release          | Release         |
   | Publishes to opam     | Yes         | No               | No              |

    - All release tag pipelines types publish [Release] type Docker builds.
    - No release tag pipelines include experimental binaries.
    - [Release_tag] and [Beta_release_tag] pipelines creates GitLab
    and publishes releases. [Non_release_tag] pipelines create the
    GitLab release but do not publish them.
    - Only [Release_tag] pipelines publish to opam. *)
