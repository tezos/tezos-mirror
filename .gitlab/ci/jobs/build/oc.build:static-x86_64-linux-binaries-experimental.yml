# This version of the job builds both released and experimental executables.
# It is used in the following pipelines:
# - Before merging: check whether static executables still compile,
#   i.e. that we do pass the -static flag and that when we do it does compile
# - Master branch: executables (including experimental ones) are used in some test networks
# Variants:
# - an arm64 variant exist, but is only used in the master branch pipeline
#   (no need to test that we pass the -static flag twice)
# - released variants exist, that are used in release tag pipelines
#   (they do not build experimental executables)

  extends:
    - .tags_template__build
    - .oc.build_static_binaries_template
    # Even though not many tests depend on static executables, some of those that do
    # are limiting factors in the total duration of pipelines.
    # So we start this job as early as possible, without waiting for sanity_ci.
