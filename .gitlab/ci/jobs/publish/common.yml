#
# Templates for building deb & rpm packages.
#
# The AWS resources used for the packaging are managed on https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/iac/terraform/octez-packaging
#
# Specifically we use 2 S3 buckets to host the deb and rpm packages and one IAM role which has the ability to
# push changes. The jobs use the OpenID protocol to connect to AWS, receive temporary credentials and assume
# the IAM role.
#
# Details can be found on the following links:
# - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_services/index.html#configure-a-conditional-role-with-oidc-claims
