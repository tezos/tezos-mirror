  # We specify the image by hash to avoid flakiness. Indeed, if we took the
  # latest release, then an update in the parser or analyser could result in new
  # errors being found even if the code doesn't change. This would place the
  # burden for fixing the code on the wrong dev (the devs who happen to open an
  # MR coinciding with the semgrep update rather than the dev who wrote the
  # infringing code in the first place).
  # Update the hash in scripts/semgrep/README.md too when updating it here
  # Last update: 20212-01-03
