# Definition for the environment to run all integration tests.
# This is also used by Tezt tests.
# In general we do not have to run make, which takes a while,
# because the binaries have been produced by the build job and are
# in the cache. But if they are not, we need to build them.
# Ideally we should also check that the baker / accuser / endorser
# exist (some tests use them) but their actual name depend on the protocol.
