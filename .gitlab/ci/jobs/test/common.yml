    # The record artifacts (tezt-results-$CI_NODE_INDEX.json) should

    # more than enough. However, we set it to 3 days to keep records
    # over the weekend. The tezt artifacts (including records and
    # coverage) take up roughly 2MB / job. Total artifact storage
    # becomes N*P*T*W where N is the days of retention (3 atm), P the
    # number of pipelines per day (~200 atm), T the number of Tezt
    # jobs per pipeline (60) and W the artifact size per tezt job
    # (2MB). This makes 35GB which is less than 0.5% than our total
    # artifact usage (https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/artifacts).

    # For Tezt tests, there are multiple timeouts:
    # - --global-timeout is the internal timeout of Tezt, which only works if tests
    #   are cooperative;
    # - the "timeout" command, which we set to send SIGTERM to Tezt 60s after --global-timeout
    #   in case tests are not cooperative;
    # - the "timeout" command also sends SIGKILL 60s after having sent SIGTERM in case
    #   Tezt is still stuck;
    # - the CI timeout.
    # The use of the "timeout" command is to make sure that Tezt eventually exits,
    # because if the CI timeout is reached, there are no artefacts,
    # and thus no logs to investigate.
