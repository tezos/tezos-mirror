    # In short, GitLab requires a code quality report from the target branch.
    # As ometrics tries to find code quality issues against the target branch
    # (i.e. previously introduced issues will not be reported), we create a fake
    # empty report on the default branch which is supposed to be the target branch
    # in most cases.
