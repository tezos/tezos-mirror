(** [times kind ops round]

    @param kind either [Attestation] or [Preattestation]
    @param ops list of received operations used to look for timestamp
    @param round the round concerned

    Associate the reception time of an operation to the corresponding delegate.
    If multiple sources are available, the minimum time is selected.

    Note that it is likely to lead to false results unless you filter out
    [ops] according to their [source] because it mixes times from
    different teztale archivers.

    Let's imagine the worst kind of error that can be produced:

    Archiver A1 receives attestation from delegate D1 at T1
    Archiver A2 receives attestation from delegate D2 at T2

    The times reported by this function, using these data, would be
    [ (D1, T1) ; (D2, T2) ] that could lead to a consensus reached at T2
    whereas in reality, no node has received both attestation,
    so none reached quorum.

    Filter your input data if you want to avoid this.
