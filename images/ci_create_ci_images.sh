# Build images for CI jobs and the Octez Docker Distribution.

# Reads the following environment variables:
#  - 'ci_image_name'
#  - 'ci_image_tag' (optional)
#  - 'ARCH'
#  - 'CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_PIPELINE_ID': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_PIPELINE_URL': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_JOB_ID': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_JOB_URL': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_COMMIT_SHA': set by GitLab CI
#
# The image is tagged with
# $ci_image_name:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG and
# $ci_image_name:TAG. If
# $ci_image_tag is set, then TAG contains this
# value. If not, TAG contains a hash of this image's inputs.
#
# When running in the CI, $ci_image_tag is not set. The
# image is tagged with the input hash. In order for subsequent jobs to
# use the image built by this script, it stores the TAG in a dotenv
# file that is passed as artifacts to those jobs. By also tagging with
# the $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG, we allow subsequent pipelines to refer to
# images built on a given branch, which is used for caching.
#
# When building the image, we get caches from
#  - $ci_image_name:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG and
#  - $ci_image_name:$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH.
# That is, from previous builds on the same branch and from previous
# builds on the master branch.
#
# The inputs of this image is the set of paths defined in
# 'images/ci/inputs'.
