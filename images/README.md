# `tezos/tezos` Docker images

This directory contains the definition of Docker images used to build
the Docker distribution of Octez.

The images, their content and indented usage, are:

| Image                      | Contents                                | Usage                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `rust-toolchain`           | cargo                                   | CI: kernel build, test and SDK |
| `jsonnet`                  | jsonnet                                 | CI: Grafazos jobs              |
| `client-libs-dependencies` | kaitai-struct-compiler, xxd, java, node | CI: Kaitai e2e tests           |
| `ci`                       | ocaml, cargo, npm, python ...           | CI: the majority of jobs       |

For more details on the contents and usage of each image, see below,
in the header comment of each corresponding Dockerfile and in the
`IMAGE/README.md` file when applicable.

## Input hashes

Images are rebuilt on-demand in the Tezos CI whenever one of their
*inputs* change.  The inputs are image-specific and correspond to a
set of paths in the tree. Images are tagged with the input hash and
the branch on which they were produced (see `images/image_tag.sh` for
more details).

## Image build contexts

Build contexts for image builds are produced from the images build
context directory `images/IMAGE_NAME`. All files in this folder will
be available to the Dockerfile during build.

## Image provenance

Provenance meta-data can be found by inspecting the labels of an
image's manifest:

 - `com.tezos.build-pipeline-id`: The ID of the CI pipeline in which
   the image was produced.
 - `com.tezos.build-pipeline-url`: The URL of the CI pipeline in which
   the image was produced.
 - `com.tezos.build-job-id`: The ID of the CI job in which the image
   was produced.
 - `com.tezos.build-job-url`: The URL of the CI job on which the image
   was produced.
 - `com.tezos.build-tezos-revision`: The git commit SHA for which the
   image was produced.

These labels can be extracted from a locally pulled image using
`docker image inspect`.

## Usage in the Tezos CI

If you modify the definition of these images above, then the Tezos CI
will automatically rebuild it and the new image will be used in
subsequent jobs of the pipeline. This works by tagging each image with
its input hash, and putting this tag as a variable in a [dotenv report
artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportsdotenv).
Jobs that use the image refer to this variable in their `image:`
field and thus reuse the image directly.

# `rust-toolchain` image

The `rust-toolchain` image is used in the CI to build and test
kernels, and to build the kernel SDK. It is also used to build the
`evm_kernel` included in the Octez Docker distribution. To build this
image for local use, run `create_image.sh "rust-toolchain"`.

# `jsonnet` image

The `jsonnet` image is used in the CI to build and test Grafazos.
It contains the `jsonnet` tools to compile and format jsonnet files.
To build this image for local use, run `create_image.sh "grafazos"`

# `client-libs-dependencies` image

The `client-libs-depencies` image is used in the CI to run end-to-end
tests of client-libs. To build this image for local use, run
`create_client_libs_dependencies_image.sh`.

# `ci` images

The `ci` images is a suite of images, defined as different layer in
the Dockerfile `ci/Dockerfile`. It is used in the CI to run a wide
variety of jobs.  Its `runtime` and `build` layers are also used as
input for the Octez Docker distribution.  To build these images for
local use, run `create_ci_image.sh`.


# Common files in `common`

Files that are shared between image built contexts are stored in
`common` and are symlinked into the build contexts for images that
require them. `docker build` does not resolve symlinks, but we work
around this by tarring the image's build context directory, having tar
resolve symlinks and piping the result to `docker build`. See
`create_client_libs_dependencies_image.sh` for an example.

# Building the Octez Docker Distribution

To build the Octez Docker distribution locally, use the script
`./scripts/create_docker_image.sh`. Called without parameters, this
script will build the Octez Docker Distribution with the *released*
set of executables (see `scripts-inputs/released-executables`) and
without EVM artifacts.

Building the Octez Docker distribution requires some of the CI images
as input. The definition of these input images can be found in
`images/ci`, and they can be built locally using
`./images/create_ci_images.sh.`

By default, the script `./scripts/create_docker_image.sh` looks for a
version of the CI images that corresponds to the current state
of the checkout (see `images/image_tag.sh` for more info). To use a
custom version, for instance the CI images built in a specific
pipeline, see the parameters `--ci-image-name` and
`--ci-image-version`.

To build the Octez Docker Distribution with EVM artifacts, pass
`--docker-target with-evm-artifacts` to
`./scripts/create_docker_image.sh`. In addition the the CI images,
building the EVM artifacts requires the rust-toolchain image as
input. By default, the script will attempt to re-use the latest
version of this image built on the `master` branch of the tezos/tezos
CI. If you need to use a different image for the rust-toolchain image,
follow the instructions in `./images/README.MD` and
`./images/create_rust_toolchain_image.sh` to create one. Then specify
the `--rust-toolchain-image-name` and `--rust-toolchain-image-tag`
parameters to `./scripts/create_docker_image.sh` accordingly.

For more info on how to configure:
 - naming of the built images in the Octez Docker distribution,
 - input images used,
 - contents of the distribution, and
 - configuration of the version number reported by included executables,

see `./scripts/create_docker_image.sh --help`.

## Using the CI images from tezos/tezos CI

Like the Octez Docker distribution, the CI images are also built in
the tezos/tezos CI. By default, `./scripts/create_docker_image.sh` is
configured to pull the CI images from the CI's protected Docker
registry if they cannot be found locally.

Note that if the image you want to use is from a branch that has not
yet been merged to `master`, then it will not be in the protected
Docker registry, but in the public one. To configure the script to use
the public registry:

```
$ ./scripts/create_docker_image.sh \
    --ci-image-name $(. ./scripts/version.sh; echo $GCP_PUBLIC_REGISTRY)/tezos/tezos/ci
```

## Using local CI images

First, build the `ci` images locally:

```
$ ./images/create_ci_images.sh
```

The newly built images will use the same naming scheme as the images
built in the tezos/tezos CI. Therefore, you can now simply rebuild the
Octez Docker distribution and it will automatically use the locally
built CI images:

```
$ ./scripts/create_docker_image.sh
```

To make this more explicit, run:

```
$ ./images/create_ci_images.sh \
    --image-base octez-local-ci \
    --tag-suffix ""
$ ./scripts/create_docker_image.sh \
    --ci-image-name octez-local-ci \
    --ci-image-version "amd64"
```

The first command will create the set of CI images on the following naming scheme:

 - `octez-local-ci/runtime:amd64`
 - `octez-local-ci/prebuild:amd64`
 - ...

(These images are always tagged by architecture, and the architecture defaults to amd64).

The parameters to the second command instructs
`create_docker_image.sh` to use these images as base images.
