# runtime + build dependencies

# This image builds upon the `prebuild` image,
# see its header for details on its content.

# It removes the `cache for opam build-dependencies` from that image, and adds:
# - opam build-dependencies
#
# This image is intended for
# - building tezos from source
# - building images on top of it in the image stack (see README.md)
