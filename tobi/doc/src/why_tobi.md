# Why "Tobi"

Why is Tobi called "Tobi"?

## The boring reason

Tobi is a short-hand for "TOolBox Infra".

## The fancy reason

In the game of go, a tobi is two stones separated by one empty intersection.
The stones are technically separated.
But there is a saying that "a tobi is connected".
This is because trying to separate a tobi is often a bad idea.

In our [vision for the monorepo](the_vision_for_the_monorepo.md),
we want clearly separated components. Yet we need them to be connected.
Tobi is the glue that connects clearly separated components.
