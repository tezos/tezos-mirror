### BEGINNING OF tobi/config-manual

# This file is included into tobi/config when it is generated by the manifest.
# If the manifest does not know about some paths that are needed by some components,
# you can add those paths here.

# Always needed by all components.
__pervasive: dune, dune-project

# A consequence of the previous line: this script is needed by one of the rules in "dune".
__pervasive: scripts/custom-flags.sh

# Needed to build "tezos-sapling" in "src/lib_sapling".
octez-libs: src/rustzcash_deps/include

# Needed to build Rust components.
__pervasive: rust-toolchain

# Information present in the "deps" stanzas of "src/rust_deps/dune".
# Note that src/rust_deps itself is included automatically (recursively),
# so we only need to manually add paths that start with "../" in "src/rust_deps/dune".
octez-rust-deps: src/rustzcash_deps, src/riscv, src/kernel_sdk, sdk/rust

# Information present in the "copy_files" stanza of "src/lib_riscv/api/dune".
octez-riscv-api: src/riscv/lib

# Headers declared as (deps) in the (ctypes) stanza of src/lib_wasmer/dune.
# The manifest does not include (ctypes (deps)) in tobi/config yet.

octez-l2-libs: src/rust_deps/wasmer-3.3.0/lib/c-api/wasm.h
# wasm.h is actually a symbolic link to the following file:
